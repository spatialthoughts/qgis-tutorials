Web Mapping with QGIS2Web
=========================

.. warning:: 

   This tutorial is now obsolete. A new and updated version is available at :doc:`3/web_mapping_with_qgis2web`

Web mapping is a great medium to publish your GIS data to ther web and make it
accessible by other users. Creating a web map is a very different process than
creating one in a GIS. GIS users are typically aren't web programmers and it
presents a challenge when one needs to create a web map that is of the same
quality as a map creating in a GIS. Fortunately, there are tools available to
easily translate your work in QGIS to web maps. In this tutorial, you will
learn how to use the **QGIS2Web** plugin to create a web map using OpenLayers
or Leaflet lubraries from your QGIS project.


Overview of the task
--------------------

We will create a openlayers web map of world's airports.

Other skills you will learn
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- How to use Edit Widgets in QGIS to hide certain fields and set custom types.
- How to create a virtual field using Field Calculator.
- Creating labels for features that appear only at certain scale.

Get the data
------------

We will use the `Airports
<http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/airports/>`_
dataset from Natural Earth.

Download the `Airports shapefile
<http://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/10m/cultural/ne_10m_airports.zip>`_.

For convenience, you may directly download a copy of the datasets from the links
below:

`ne_10m_airports.zip <http://www.qgistutorials.com/downloads/ne_10m_airports.zip>`_

Data Source [NATURALEARTH]_

Procedure
---------

1. Open QGIS and go to
   :menuselection:`Layer --> Add Vector Layer`. Browse to the location of the
   downloaded file and select ``ne_10m_airports.zip``. Click :guilabel:`OK`.

2. We will now create a map in QGIS that looks and behaves just like we would
   like in the web map. The plugin ``qgis2web`` will use replicate the QGIS
   settings and automatically create the web map without us knowing about web
   mapping libraries. When a user clicks on a airport marker, we want an
   info-window to disply useful information about the airport. This information
   is already present in the attribute table of the ``ne_10m_airports`` layers.
   Right-click on the ``ne_10m_airports`` layer and select
   :guilabel:`Properties`.

3. Switch to the :guilabel:`Fields` tab. You will notice the different
   attributes present in the layer. Some of these aren't relevant to the users
   of our web map, so we can choose to hide these. We will keep ``type``,
   ``name``, ``iata_code`` and ``wikipedia`` fields and hide the others. Click
   on :guilabel:`Text Edit` button under the :guilabel:`Edit widget` column
   for ```scalerank`` field.

.. image:: /static/web_mapping_with_qgis2web/images/3.png
   :align: center

4. In the :guilabel:`Edit Widget Properties` dialog, choose ``Hidden`` as the
   type. Click :guilabel:`OK`.

.. image:: /static/web_mapping_with_qgis2web/images/4.png
   :align: center

5. Similarly set other fields to Hidden type. As you may have notices, there
   are other field types available that allow us to set how the fields appear
   to the users of our map. Click :guilabel:`Edit Widget` for ``wikipedia``
   field.

.. image:: /static/web_mapping_with_qgis2web/images/5.png
   :align: center

6. Select ``Web View`` as the field type. This type indicates that the value
   contained in this field is a URL.

.. image:: /static/web_mapping_with_qgis2web/images/6.png
   :align: center

7. We can also use the :guilabel:`Alias` column to indicate an alternate name
   for the fields without actually changing the underlying data table. This is
   useful to give more user-friendly field names to the users of our map. Add
   aliases as per your choices and click :guilabel:`Ok`.

.. image:: /static/web_mapping_with_qgis2web/images/7.png
   :align: center

8. Back in the main QGIS window, choose the :guilabel:`Identify` tool and click
   on any point. The :guilabel:`Identify Results` panel will display the
   nicely formallted attributes with the newly added aliases. You will notice
   that the hidden fields do not appear in the results.

.. image:: /static/web_mapping_with_qgis2web/images/8.png
   :align: center

9. While this method is useful, there is one limitation. We are not able to
   change the order of the fields. One way to overcome this limitation is to
   create a ``Virtual Field``. In our case, if we wanted the ``type`` field to
   appear at the end of the info window, we can simply add a new virtual field
   the end and hide the original ``type`` field. While we are at it - we can
   also use an expression to better format the type values. Right-click the
   ``ne_10m_airports`` layer and choose :guilabel:`Properties`. Go to the
   :guilabel:`Fields` tab and click :guilabel:`Field Calculator`.

.. image:: /static/web_mapping_with_qgis2web/images/9.png
   :align: center

10. As the field names need to be unique, use ``Type`` as the new field name.
    Set the field type to ``Text (String)`` with a length of ``25`` characters.
    The field ``type`` contains values such as ``small``, ``mid``, ``large``
    etc. We can add an expression to change the case of the words to sentence
    case and append the word *airport* for better readability. Enter the
    following expression in the :guilabel:`Expression` box and click
    :guilabel:`OK`.

.. code-block:: none

   concat( title("type"), ' Airport')

.. image:: /static/web_mapping_with_qgis2web/images/10.png
   :align: center

11. Now that we have a much better looking ``Type`` field, you can go ahead and
    set the :guilabel:`Edit Widget` for ``type`` field to ``Hidden``.

.. image:: /static/web_mapping_with_qgis2web/images/11.png
   :align: center

12. Use the :guilabel:`Identify` tool to verify that the attributes appear as
    expected.

.. image:: /static/web_mapping_with_qgis2web/images/12.png
   :align: center

13. Now let's style our layer to be more visually appealing and informative.
    Right-click the ``ne_10m_airports`` layer and select
    :guilabel:`Properties`. Switch to the :guilabel:`Style` tab. Choose
    ``Categorized`` style and our virtual field ``Type`` as the
    :guilabel:`Column`. Click :guilabel:`Classify`.

.. image:: /static/web_mapping_with_qgis2web/images/13.png
   :align: center

14. You will see a different colored circle gets assigned to a differnt type of
    airport. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will restrict the map to
    civilian airports. Hold the :kbd:`Ctrl` key and select all categories for
    military airports. Once selected, click :guilabel:`Delete`.

.. image:: /static/web_mapping_with_qgis2web/images/14.png
   :align: center

15. Apart from assigning a different color to the category, we can change the
    size of the symbol to visually help our users distinguish different type
    of airports. Right-click on a category and select :guilabel:`Change
    size`.

.. image:: /static/web_mapping_with_qgis2web/images/15.png
   :align: center

16. Set the :guilabel:`Size` value to ``3`` for the ``Large Airport`` category.

.. image:: /static/web_mapping_with_qgis2web/images/16.png
   :align: center

17. Similarly, set the :guilabel:`Size` to ``2`` for ``Mid Airport`` and ``1``
    for ``Small Airport``.

.. image:: /static/web_mapping_with_qgis2web/images/17.png
   :align: center

18. For a complete map, we also need to label each airport. Switch to the
    :guilabel:`Labels` tab in the :guilabel:`Properties` dialog. Select ``Show
    labels for this layer`` and choose ``iata_code`` as the value for
    :guilabel:`Label with`. We will also set :guilabel:`Rendering` option so
    that the labels only appear when the user is sufficiently zoomed in. Check
    :guilabel:`Scale-based visibility` under :guilabel:`Label options`. Enter
    ``1`` as the :guilabel:`Minimum` scale and ``10000000`` as the maximum
    scale. This setting will render the labels only after the user has zoomed
    in more than ``1:10000000`` scale and will be visible till ``1:1`` scale.

.. image:: /static/web_mapping_with_qgis2web/images/18.png
   :align: center

19. As we are using circles to depict the airports, we need to ensure that the
    labels don't overlap with the circles. Go to the :guilabel:`Placement` tab
    in the :guilabel:`Labels` dialog and set the :guilabel:`Placement` to
    ``Cartographic``. Select ``From symbol bounds`` as :guilabel:`Distance
    offset from`. Click :guilabel:`OK`.

.. image:: /static/web_mapping_with_qgis2web/images/19.png
   :align: center

20. Our map is now ready. This is a good time to save our work. Go to
    :menuselection:`Project --> Save`. Enter ``Airports`` as the name of the
    project.

.. image:: /static/web_mapping_with_qgis2web/images/20.png
   :align: center


21. Now we are ready to export our project to a web map. Install the
    ``qgis2web`` plugin by going to :menuselection:`Plugins --> Manage and
    Install Plugin` (See :doc:`using_plugins` for more details on installing
    plugins in QGIS). Once the plugin is installed, go to :menuselection:`Web --> qgis2web -->
    Create a web map`.

.. image:: /static/web_mapping_with_qgis2web/images/21.png
   :align: center

22. In the :guilabel:`Export to web map` dialog, check :guilabel:`Add layers
    list` in the bottom panel under the :guilabel:`Appearance` section. Also
    select ``ne_10m_airports: iata_code`` as the field for :guilabel:`Label
    search`. Check the :guilabel:`Show popups on hover` to allow display of
    info-windows on hover. We can also set a basemap so the users have more
    context when looking at the airports layer. Select ``OSM B&W`` to use a
    black-and-white themed basemap create using OpenStreetMap data. You also
    have an option to choose from either ``OpenLayers`` or ``Leaflet`` as the
    web mapping library. We will restrict this tutorial to use the
    ``OpenLayers`` library. Click :guilabel:`Update Preview`` to see how your
    exported map will look like. Before we do the actual export, we need to set
    the :guilabel:`Export folder`. You can select a folder of your choice and
    click :guilabel:`Export`.

.. image:: /static/web_mapping_with_qgis2web/images/22.png
   :align: center

23. Once the export is complete, the default browser for your computer will
    open and show the interactive web map.

.. image:: /static/web_mapping_with_qgis2web/images/23.png
   :align: center

24. Your web map is now ready for publishing.

25. The ``qgis2web`` plugin has many limitations and it cannot do everything
    that the powerful web mapping libraries ``OpenLayers`` and ``Leaflet`` can
    do. This process can act as the starting point in your web mapping process
    and save you valuable time by creating a basic template from which you can
    further customize the web map. To highlight the fact that the output
    created from this process can be readily changed to suit your requirement -
    we will make a simple change to the web map to zoom to a particular airport
    when the user initially loads the map. On your computer, go to the folder
    where the web map was exported.  Locate the ``resources`` folder and open
    ``qgis2web.js`` file in a text editor.

.. image:: /static/web_mapping_with_qgis2web/images/25.png
   :align: center

26. Locate the line where the ``map.getView().fit()`` function is called and
    add the following code after that. This new line of code instructs the web
    browser to center the map on the coordinates of Paris. Save the changes to
    the ``qgis2web.js`` file.

.. code-block:: none

   map.getView().setCenter(ol.proj.fromLonLat([2.35, 48.85]))

.. image:: /static/web_mapping_with_qgis2web/images/26.png
   :align: center

27. Refresh your browser and see that the web map will load with Paris at the
    center.  This is a trivial example, but you can see how you can use any
    function available in the ``OpenLayers`` or ``Leaflet`` libraries to
    customize the web map.

28. The exported map resides on your computer. While you can see it in action,
    it is not very useful since you cannot share it anyone. For others to be
    able to see the map, you need to upload it to a web server. While the
    upload process will vary on the type of server you have access to - a cheap
    and easy way to publish your map on the web would be to use any of the
    public cloud storage services. `Amazon S3 <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/>`_ is
    a popular storage service. You will need to sign up for an account and
    follow the instructions to create a bucket. Once a bucket is created, you
    can upload the contents of your exported folder to the bucket and set it to
    public. Here I created a bucket named ``qgis-tutorials`` and uploaded the
    contents of my exported folder to a sub-folder named ``qgis2web``. You can
    access the resulting map at
    http://s3.amazonaws.com/qgis-tutorials/qgis2web/index.html

.. image:: /static/web_mapping_with_qgis2web/images/28.png
   :align: center

29. Similarly, Google also offers a cloud storage service called `Google Cloud
    Storage <https://cloud.google.com/storage/>`_. Once you have created an
    account and enable billing, you can create a bucket and upload objects to
    the bucket. I create a bucket and sub-folder similar to Amazon and set the
    folder to public. The resulting map can be viewed at
    https://storage.googleapis.com/qgis-tutorials/qgis2web/index.html
