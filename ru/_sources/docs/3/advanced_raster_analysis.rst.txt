Advanced Raster Analysis (QGIS3)
================================

In the previous tutorial :doc:`raster_styling_and_analysis`, you learnt about performing raster algebra with *Raster Calculator*. This tutorial builds on these techniques and shows you how to use other raster analysis tools from the Processing Toolbox. You will learn how to process with Land Use Land Cover (LULC) rasters in QGIS to extract certain types of landcover classes and map changes.

Overview of the task
--------------------

We will use the South African National Land Cover dataset to identify and extract informal settlements in the City of Johannesburg, South Africa. We will also use a change assessment dataset to identify urban growth patterns in the city from 2014 to 2018.


Other skills you will learn

Procedure
--------------

1. Browse to the downloaded and unzipped  folder in the browser. Expand it and drag and drop the ``SA_NLC_2018_ALBERS_CALC.tif`` in canvas.

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/01.png
    :align: center

2.  Once the layer is loaded, you can notice the CRS will be set as :guilabel:`Unknown CRS` on the bottom right. Double-click on it to open the :guilabel:`Project Properties - CRS` dialog box. 

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/02.png
    :align: center

3. At the bottom, you will see a preview of the projection extent. This *Unknown CRS* is a custom *Lambert Equal-Area Projection* defined for the country of South Africa. We will later reproject this layer to another projection. Click :guilabel:`OK`. 

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/03.png
    :align: center

4. Load other two layers ``SA_NLC_2014_2018_CLASS_CHANGE_ALBERS_CALC.tif`` and ``COJ_Boundary``. You will see that the raster layer cover the entire country. For our analysis, we are only interested in the area covered by the ``COJ_Boundary`` layer. We will now clip the raster layer to this region. Go to :menuselection:`Processing --> Toolbox --> GDAL --> Raster extraction --> Clip raster by mask layer` tool. Double-click to open it.

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/04.png
    :align: center

5. In the :guilabel:`Clip Raster by Mask Layer`, select ``SA_NLC_2018_ALBERS_CALC``  as the :guilabel:`Input layer`, then ``COJ_Boundary`` as :guilabel:`Mask layer`. We also have an option to reproject the data to another projection. It is a good practice to keep all your data layers in the same projection. We will reproject the rasters to match the CRS to that of the ``COJ_Boundary`` layer. Select ``EPSG:4326 - WGS 84`` as the :guilabel:`Target CRS`.

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/05.png
    :align: center

6. The default output data format is GeoTiff. GeoTiff files can get very large if they are not compressed. A good practice is to always apply a loss-less compression when creating new raster layers. Expand :guilabel:`Advanced Parameters` and choose ``High Compression`` as the :guilabel:`Profile`. Next, click the ``...`` button next to :guilabel:`Clipped (mask)` and select :guilabel:`Save to file...` to enter layer name as ``SA_NLC_2018_Clipped``. Click :guilabel:`Run`.

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/06.png
    :align: center

7. Once the algorithm finishes, do not close the window. We will apply the same operation to the other raster layer. Switch to the :guilabel:`Parameters` tab and change the :guilabel:`Input layer` to ``SA_NLC_2014_2018_CLASS_CHANGE_ALBERS_CALC``. Keep all other options but change the output layer name to ``SA_NLC_2014_2018_CLASS_CHANGE_Clipped``. Click :guilabel:`Run`.

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/07.png
    :align: center

8. Both clipped layers will now be loaded in canvas. Select the original layer and click :guilabel:`Remove Layer` to remove them. 

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/08.png
    :align: center

9.  All the three remaining layers are now in the same CRS. We can switch the project CRS to the CRS of the layers now. Right click on any clipped layer and choose :menuselection:`Layer CRS --> Set Project CRS from Layer`. 

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/09.png
    :align: center

10. Now the project CRS will be set to ``EPSG:4326``. Bring the :guilabel:`SA_NLC_2018_Clipped` layer to top. 

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/10.png
    :align: center

11. Click on `SA_NLC_2018_Clipped` and use the :guilabel:`identify` tool in the :guilabel:`Attributes Toolbar` to click on the image and inspect the pixel values. You will see that the pixel values range from 1 to 73. These values represent a distinct land use/land cover class.

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/11.png
    :align: center

12. The dataset classes are described in the ``SANLC 2018 Presentation``, which can be downloaded from the `EGIS Portal <https://egis.environment.gov.za/sa_national_land_cover_datasets>`_. For this exercise, we are interested in the *informal settlements* represented by class numbers 51 through 54.

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/12.png
    :align: center

13. Let's extract pixels belonging to these classes. Go to :menuselection:`Processing --> Toolbox --> Raster analysis --> Raster calculator` tool. Double-click to open it.

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/13.png
    :align: center
	
14. Click the ``...`` button next to :guilabel:`Input layers`. Select the ``SA_NLC_2018_Clipped`` layer and click :guilabel:`OK`. Next, click on the ``Îµ`` button to open the expression window.

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/14.png
    :align: center
	
15. Enter the following expression to select pixels from class 51-54. The source image has only 1 band. The ``@1`` suffix indicates the band number. Click :guilabel:`OK` to close the expression window.

  .. code-block:: none

     "SA_NLC_2018_Clipped@1" >= 51 AND "SA_NLC_2018_Clipped@1" <= 54


  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/15.png
    :align: center

16. Next, click the ``...`` button next to :guilabel:`Calculated` and select :guilabel:`Save to File...`.

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/16.png
    :align: center

17. Name the output file ``residential_informal.tif`` and click :guilabel:`Run`.

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/17.png
    :align: center

18. Once the process finishes, a new layer, ``residential_informal`` will be added to QGIS. This raster layer has only two-pixel values - ``1`` where our expression evaluated *true* and ``0`` where it was *false*. The pixels that appear white are the ones belonging to the informal settlement classes. We will style this layer better so we can see the informal settlements clearly. Click the :guilabel:`Open the layer styling panel` button.

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/18.png
    :align: center

19.  Select the ``residential_informal`` layer and change the renderer to be :guilabel:`Paletted/Unique values`. Click the :guilabel:`Add values manually` (+) button.

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/19.png
    :align: center

20. Change the :guilabel:`Value` to ``1`` and enter ``Residential Informal`` as :guilabel:`Label`. Select a color of your choice.

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/20.png
    :align: center

21. We can now see all the informal settlements in the city of Johannesburg. It would be helpful to see them in context with a base map. We have access to a variety of base maps from the :guilabel:`QuickMapServices` plugin. Once you install the plugin, go to :menuselection:`Web --> QuickMapServices --> OSM --> OSM Standard` to add the OpenStreetMap layer.

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/21.png
    :align: center

22. Now you can easily identify and verify whether our analysis correctly identified the informal settlements. You can select the ``residential_informal`` layer and switch to the :guilabel:`Transparency` tab in the :guilabel:`Layer styling panel`. You can reduce the :guilabel:`Global Opacity` to see both the extracted pixels and the base-map together.

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/22.png
    :align: center


23. You have now completed the first part of the tutorial. Now we will use the ``SA_NLC_2014_2018_CHANGE_Clipped`` raster layer to identify regions that were urbanized between 2014 and 2018. Turn off all layers except ``SA_NLC_2014_2018_CHANGE_Clipped``, then click the :guilabel:`Open the layer styling panel` button. Switch to the :guilabel:`Transparency` tab and enter ``0`` in :guilabel:`Additional no data value`. This will set the pixels with value 0 to transparent.

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/23.png
    :align: center

24.  Use the :guilabel:`Identify` tool in the :guilabel:`Attributes Toolbar` to click on the image and inspect the pixel values. You will see that the pixel values range from 21-420. Each value indicates a transition from one of the 73 source classes to another class.

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/24.png
    :align: center

25. Your data download comes with a spreadsheet named ``lcccodes.xlsx``. This sheet has a sheet **03 urban_change_codes** that gives more details about each pixel value. We are interested in all pixel values where any 2014 class changed into a 2018 built-up class. In the image below, these are highlighted in blue.

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/25.png
    :align: center

26. Our goal is to map changes in the built-up class. We will apply a transformation on the ``SA_NLC_2014_2018_CHANGE_Clipped`` layer so all the pixel values are mapped from their original values to either of the following values.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 50

   * - ``1`` 
     - All pixels which were a built-up class in both 2014 and 2018
   * - ``2`` 
     - All pixels which changed from a non built-up class in 2014 to a built-up class in 2018.
   * - ``0``
     - All remaining pixels

27. To do this, we need to create a table specifying these rules. As QGIS is able to read spreadsheets directly, it is the most convenient method to create this table. Our spreadsheet should have 3 columns, ``MIN``, ``MAX``, and ``OUTPUT``. Each row should be the range of input raster values that should be assigned an output value. Create a spreadsheet as shown below and save it to your computer as ``reclass.xlsx``. You may also download a ready-to-use copy from this link - `reclass.xlsx <https://www.qgistutorials.com/downloads/reclass.xlsx>`_

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/27.png
    :align: center

28. Locate the ``reclass.xlsx`` file in the browser. Drag-and-drop it to the main window.

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/28.png
    :align: center

29. A new layer ``Sheet1`` will be added to the :guilabel:`Layers` panel. Right-click on it and select :guilabel:`Open Attribute Table`. Verify that the sheet was imported correctly and you have 3 columns named ``MIN``, ``MAX`` and ``OUTPUT``. Open the :menuselection:`Processing Toolbox --> Reclassify by layer` tool.

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/29.png
    :align: center

30. In the :guilabel:`Reclassify by layer` dialog, select ``SA_NLC_2014_2018_CHANGE_Clipped`` as the :guilabel:`Raster layer`. Select ``Sheet1`` as the :guilabel:`Layer containing class breaks`. Select ``MIN``, ``MAX`` and ``OUTPUT`` fields for their respective fields.

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/30.png
    :align: center

31. Expand the :guilabel:`Advanced Parameters` section. Change the :guilabel:`Range boundaries` to ``min <= value <= max``. Click the :guilabel:`...` button for :guilabel:`Reclassified raster` and enter the output file name as ``builtup_change.tif``. Click :guilabel:`Run`.

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/31.png
    :align: center

32. Once the processing finishes, a new layer ``builtup_change`` with pixel values ``0-2`` will be added to the canvas. In the :guilabel:`Layer styling panel`, choose ``Paletted/Unique values``, then click ``Classify``. 

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/32.png
    :align: center

33. Choose the color of your choice for each category and label the ``0``, ``1`` , and ``2`` pixel values as ``Non Built-up``, ``Existing Built-up`` and ``New Built-up``.

  .. image:: /static/3/advanced_raster_analysis/images/33.png
    :align: center

34. Now in the :guilabel:`Transparency` tab, reduce the :guilabel:`Global Opacity`, and turn on the ``OSM Standard`` layer to see both the builtup_change pixels and the base-map together.
