Working with WMS Data
======================

.. warning:: 

   This tutorial is now obsolete. A new and updated version is available at :doc:`3/working_with_wms`
   
Often you need reference data layers for your basemap or to display your
results in the context of other datasets. Many organizations publish datasets
online that can be readily used in GIS. A popular standard for publishing maps
online is called **WMS (Web Map Service)**. This is a better choice for using
reference layers as you get access to rich datasets in your GIS without the
hassle of downloading or styling the data.


Overview of the task
--------------------

In this tutorial, we will load layers of `Mineral Resources
<http://mrdata.usgs.gov/wms.html>`_ published by USGS.

Data Source: [MRDATA]_

Procedure
---------

1. Open QGIS and go to on :menuselection:`Layer --> Add WMS Layer...`.

2. In the :guilabel:`Layers` tab, click on :guilabel:`New`.

3. Name your connection. This is not the name of the layer but the name of
   service which is offering the WMS layer. A single service usually offers
   multiple layers that can be added to your project. The URL that you need to
   access a WMS layer is called *GetCapabilities*. When you access a WMS server
   with this parameter in the URL, it returns a list of layers available along
   with various metadata. In this case, name the connection as ``MRDATA USGS``
   and the GetCapabilities URL as
   ``http://mrdata.usgs.gov/services/ca?request=getcapabilities&service=WMS&version=1.1.1&``.
   Click :guilabel:`OK`.

4. Next, click on the :guilabel:`Connect` button to fetch the list of layers available. You
   will notice different IDs listed next to the layers. ID ``0`` means you get a
   map of all the layers. If you do not want all the layers, you can expand the
   list by clicking on :guilabel:`+` icon and selecting the layer of interest. Select the
   layer ``0`` for this tutorial.

5.  In the :guilabel:`Image encoding` section, you need to choose an image
    format. Image formats matter a great deal and which one you choose depends on your use case. Here
    are some pointers

    - Quality: PNG is a lossless compressed image format. JPEG is lossy
      compressed format. TIFF can be either. That means the quality of PNG
      images will be better compared to JPEG. If your main purpose is to print
      a map, use PNG.

    - Speed: Since PNG images are uncompressed and thus larger in size,
      they will take longer to load. If you are using the layer in your project
      as a reference layer and need to zoom/pan a lot, use JPEG.

    - Client Support: QGIS supports most of the formats, but if you are
      developing web applications, browsers usually do not support TIFF,
      so you should choose another format.

    - Type of data: If your layers are primarily vector, PNG will give better
      results. For imagery layers, JPEG is usually a better choice.

    For this tutorial, choose :guilabel:`JPEG` as the format. Change the
    :guilabel:`Layer name` if you wish and click :guilabel:`Add`.

6. You will see the layer loaded in the QGIS canvas. You can zoom/pan around
   just like any other layer. The way WMS service works is that every time you
   zoom/pan, it sends your viewport coordinates to the server and the server
   creates an image for that viewport and return it to the client. So there
   will be some delay before you see the image for the area after you have
   zoomed in. Also, since the data you see is an image, there is no way to
   query for attributes like in a regular vector/imagery layer.

7. You can, however, see some metadata about the layer. Right-click the layer
   and choose :guilabel:`Properties`.

8. You will notice that the :guilabel:`Properties` dialog looks different and has fewer
   tabs. You can go to the :guilabel:`Metadata` tab to learn more about the WMS service
   and the layers.
