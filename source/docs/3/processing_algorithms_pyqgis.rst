Running Processing Algorithms via Python (QGIS3)
================================================

The Processing Toolbox in QGIS contain an ever-growing collection of geoprocessing tools. The toolbox provides an easy batch processing interface to run any algorithm on a large number of inputs. See :doc:`batch_processing`. But there are cases where you need to incorporate a little bit of custom logic in your batch processing. As all the processing algorithms can be run programmatically via the Python API, you can run them via the Python Console. This tutorial shows how to run a processing algorithm via the Python Console to perform a custom geoprocessing task in just a few lines of code. Please review the :doc:`getting_started_with_pyqgis` tutorial to get familiar with the basics of the Python Scripting environment in QGIS.

Procedure
---------

1. Unzip the ``PRISM_ppt_stable_4kmM3_2017_all_bil.zip`` file. Locate the ``PRISM_ppt_stable_4kmM3_2017_all_bil`` folder in the QGIS Browser and expand it. The folder contains 12 individual layers for each month. Hold the :kbd:`Ctrl` key and select the ``.bil`` files for all 12 months. Once selected, drag them to the canvas.

.. note::

  The data is provided in the `BIL format <http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/raster-and-images/bil-bip-and-bsq-raster-files.htm>`_. Each layer is presented with a set of files ``.bil`` file containing the actual data, a ``.hdr`` file describing the data structure and a ``.prj`` file containing the projection information. QGIS can load the ``.bil`` file and provided the other files exist in the same directory.

2. A :guilabel:`Select Transformation of PRISM_ppt_stable_4kmM3_2017_all_bil` dialog box will appear, leave the selection to default and click :guilabel:`OK`.

3. Next, unzip the ``Zip_Codes.zip`` file and extract the shapefile to a folder. Locate the ``Zip_Codes`` folder and expand it. Drag the ``Zip_Codes.shp`` file to the canvas.

  .. image:: /static/3/processing_algorithms_pyqgis/images/3.png
     :align: center

.. note::

  The unzip step is important because the Zonal Statistics algorithm works by adding a new field to the layer. If the layer is zipped, QGIS cannot update the layer.
     
4. Right-click the ``Zip_Codes`` layer and select :guilabel:`Zoom to Layer`. You will see the zip code polygons for the city of seattle and neighboring areas. 

  .. image:: /static/3/processing_algorithms_pyqgis/images/4.png
     :align: center
     
5. Go to :menuselection:`Processing --> Toolbox`.

  .. image:: /static/3/processing_algorithms_pyqgis/images/5.png
     :align: center
     
6. The algorithm to sample a raster layer using vector polygons is known as ``Zonal statistics``. Search for the algorithm in the :guilabel:`Processing Toolbox`. Select the algorithm and hover your mouse over it. You will see a tooltip with the text *Algorithm ID: 'native:zonalstatistics'*. Note this id which will be needed  to call this algorithm via the Python API. Double-click the ``Zonal Statistics`` algorithm to launch it.

  .. image:: /static/3/processing_algorithms_pyqgis/images/6.png
     :align: center
     
7. We will do a manual test run of the algorithm for a single layer. This is a useful way to check if the algorithm behaves as expected and also an easy way to find out how to pass on relevant parameters to the algorithm when using it via Python. In the :guilabel:`Zonal Statistics` dialog, select ``Zip_Codes`` as the :guilabel:`Input layer` ``PRISM_ppt_stable_4kmM3_201701_bil`` as the :guilabel:`Raster Layer` and, leave other parameters to default. Click the :guilabel:`...` button next to :guilabel:`Statistics to calculate` and select only ``Mean``, next click the :guilabel:`...` button next to :guilabel:`Zonal Statistics` and save the layer as ``january_mean.gpkg`` Click :guilabel:`Run` .

  .. image:: /static/3/processing_algorithms_pyqgis/images/7.png
     :align: center
     
8. Once the algorithm finishes, switch to the :guilabel:`Log` tab. Make a note of the :guilabel:`Input Parameters` that were passed to the algorithm. Click :guilabel:`Close`.

  .. image:: /static/3/processing_algorithms_pyqgis/images/8.png
     :align: center
     
9. Now a new layer ``january_mean`` will be added to the canvas. Let's check the results, right-click on the layer and select :guilabel:`Open Attribute Table`. This particular algorithm modifies the input zone layer in-place and adds a new column for every statistic that was selected. As we had selected only ``Mean`` value, a new column named ``_mean`` is added to the table. The ``_`` was the default prefix. When we run the algorithm for layers of each month, it will be useful to specify a custom prefix with the month number so we can easily identify the mean values for each month (i.e. 01_mean, 02_mean etc.). Specifying this custom prefix is not possible in the Batch Processing interface of QGIS and if we ran this command using that interface, we would have to manually enter the custom prefix for each layer. If you are working with a large number of layers, this can be very cumbersome. Hence, we can add this custom logic using the Python API and run the algorithm in a for-loop for each layer.

10. Back in the main QGIS window, go to :menuselection:`Plugins --> Python Console`.

  .. image:: /static/3/processing_algorithms_pyqgis/images/10.png
     :align: center
     
11. Click on the :guilabel:`show editor` button. This will open the python editor were a bunch of python code can be written and executed with a single click of a button.

  .. image:: /static/3/processing_algorithms_pyqgis/images/11.png
     :align: center

12. To run the processing algorithm via Python, we need to access names of all the layers. Enter the following code in the editor and click on the :guilabel:`Play` button. You will see the names of all layers printed in the console.

  .. code-block:: python

    root = QgsProject.instance().layerTreeRoot()
    for layer in root.children():
      print(layer.name())

  .. image:: /static/3/processing_algorithms_pyqgis/images/12.png
     :align: center

13. Now, lets calculate ``Mean`` across all months and create an single layer by adding 12 columns for each month (i.e) ``01_mean`` for January, ``02_mean`` for February and so on. This can be achieved by custom prefixing. So, for adding a custom prefix, we need to look at the layer name and extract a substring representing the month number. Enter the following code to iterate over all raster layers, extract the custom prefix and run the ``native:zonalstatisticsfb`` algorithm using it.

  .. code-block:: python

  
    root = QgsProject.instance().layerTreeRoot()

    input_layer = 'Zip_Codes'
    result_layer = input_layer
    unique_field = 'OBJECTID'

    # Iterate through all raster layers
    for layer in root.children():
      if layer.name().startswith('PRISM'):
        # Run Zonal Stats algorithm
      
        prefix = layer.name()[-6:-4]
        params = {'INPUT_RASTER': layer.name(),
            'RASTER_BAND': 1, 'INPUT': input_layer,
            'COLUMN_PREFIX': prefix+'_', 'STATISTICS': [2],
            'OUTPUT': 'memory:'
            }
        result = processing.run("native:zonalstatisticsfb", params)
        zonalstats = result['OUTPUT']
        
        # Run Join Attributes by Table to join the newly created
        # column with original layer
        params = { 'INPUT': result_layer, 'FIELD':unique_field,
            'INPUT_2': zonalstats, 'FIELD_2': unique_field, 
            'FIELDS_TO_COPY': prefix + '_' + 'mean',
            'OUTPUT': 'memory:'}
            
        result = processing.run("native:joinattributestable", params)
    
    # At the end of each iteration, update the result layer to the
    # newly processed layer, so we keep adding new fields to the same layer
    result_layer = result['OUTPUT']
    
    QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(result_layer)

  .. image:: /static/3/processing_algorithms_pyqgis/images/13.png
     :align: center

  .. note::

    The ``native:zonalstatisticsfb`` will produce new layers for each month by aggregating each month **mean** as new  layer. But to get an single layer by combaining it, we need to join all the new layers by using ``native:joinattributestable``. 
     
14. Once the processing finishes, a new layer ``output`` will be added to canvas, right-click on the layer and select :guilabel:`Open Attribute Table`.

  .. image:: /static/3/processing_algorithms_pyqgis/images/14.png
     :align: center
     
15. You will see 12 new columns added to the table with custom prefixes and mean precipitation values extracted from the raster layers.
