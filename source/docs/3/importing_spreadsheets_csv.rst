Importing Spreadsheets or CSV files (QGIS3)
===========================================
Many times the GIS data comes in a table or an Excel spreadsheet. Also, if you have a list lat/long coordinates, you can easily import this data in your GIS project.

Overview of the task
--------------------

We will be importing a text file of earthquake data to QGIS. 

Get the data
------------

NOAAâ€™s National Geophysical Data Center produces a great dataset of all significant earthquakes since 2150 BC. `Learn more. <https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/form?t=101650&s=1&d=1>`_

Download `Significant Earthquake Database <https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/results?type_0=Exact&query_0=$ID&t=101650&s=13&d=189&dfn=signif.txt>`_ text file.

For convenience, you may directly download a copy of both the datasets from the links below:

`signif.txt <https://www.qgistutorials.com/downloads/signif.txt>`_

Procedure
---------

1. Examine your tabular data source. To import this data to QGIS, you will have to save it as a text file and need at least 2 columns which contain the X and Y coordinates. If you have a spreadsheet, use `Save As` function in your program to save it as a `Tab Delimited File` or a `Comma Separated Values (CSV)` file. Once you have the data exported this way, you can open it in a text editor such as Notepad to view the contents. In case of the Significant Earthquake Database, the data already comes as a text file which contains latitude and longitude of the earthquake centers along with other related attributes. You will see that each field is separated by a TAB.

2. QGIS3 comes with a unified data manager that allows you to load all the various supported data format. Click the :guilabel:`Open Data Source Manager` button on the :guilabel:`Data Source Toolbar`. You can also use :kbd:`Ctrl + L` keyboard shortcut.

3. Switch to the :guilabel:`Delimited Text` tab. Click the :guilabel:`...` button next to :guilabel:`File name` and specify the path to the text file you downloaded. In the :guilabel:`File format` section, select :guilabel:`Custom delimiters` and check :guilabel:`Tab`. The :guilabel:`Geometry definition` secction will be auto-populated if it finds a suitable X and Y coordinate fields. In our case they are ``LONGITUDE`` and ``LATITUDE``. You may change it if the import selects the wrong fields. You can leave the :guilabel:`Geometry CRS` to the default ``EPSG:4326 WGS84`` CRS. If your file contained coordinates in a different CRS, you can select the appropriate CRS here. Click :guilabel:`OK`.

.. note::

   It is easy to confuse X and Y coordinates. Latitude specifies the north-south position of a point and hence it is a **Y** coordinate. Similarly Longitude specifies the east-west position of a point and it is a **X** coordinate.
   
4. You will now see that the data will be imported and displayed in the QGIS canvas as a new layer called ``signif``.
