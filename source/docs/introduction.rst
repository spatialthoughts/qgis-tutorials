Introduction
============

`QGIS <http://qgis.org>`_ is a popular open-source GIS with advanced
capabilities. Here is a series of tutorials and tips that show you how to
use it to tackle common GIS problems.

You may use these tutorials as a self-paced course to learn the software
thoroughly. However, each section is fairly independent, so those familiar with
QGIS can jump into any section.

You can also check out :doc:`learning_resources` for other materials to help you
learn QGIS.
