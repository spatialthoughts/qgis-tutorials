Using Google Maps Engine Connector for QGIS
===========================================
.. warning::

   As of 29 January, 2015 Google Maps Engine has stopped creation of new free
   accounts. If you already have a Maps Engine account, the Google Maps Engine
   Connector will continue to work till 29 January, 2016.

Google Maps Engine is a cloud based mapping platform for creating and sharing
custom maps. `Google Maps Engine Connector
<https://github.com/googlemaps/mapsengine-qgis-connector>`_ is a plugin
that allows you to view and upload Google Maps Engine data from within QGIS.
This tutorial will go through the process of creating a Google Maps Engine
account, obtaining necessary credentials for using the connector, creating a map
using Google Maps Engine and consuming the resulting map in QGIS.

   currently part of the Google Maps team.

Overview of the task
--------------------

We will take a line layer representing bike routes in San Francisco and upload
it to Google Maps Engine using the plugin. Once the layer is styled and a map
is created, we will add that map to QGIS as a WMS layer.

Other skills you will learn
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Using the Google Developer Console to set up a new project for using Google
  APIs.

Get the data
------------

`San Francisco Data <https://data.sfgov.org/>`_ is an excellent source
of open data for San Francisco.

1. Download the `SFMTA Bikeway Network
   <https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/SFMTA-Bikeway-Network/t6vv-tjkd>`_
   shapefile using the Export option on the portal.

Create a Google Maps Engine account
-----------------------------------

2. You can sign up for a free Google Maps Engine trial account. The trial
   account is a full featured Maps Engine instance with limited storage quota.
   Visit `Google Maps Engine homepage
   <http://www.google.com/enterprise/mapsearth/products/mapsengine.html>`_ and
   click the :guilabel:`Get started with a free account` link.

3. You will need to sign-in to your Google account. If you wish to use your
   work email, you can create a new Google account with your work email address
   as well. Once signed in, you will see the :guilabel:`Create a Maps Engine
   Project` screen. Enter a :guilabel:`Project Name` which will identify your
   account when using Google Maps Engine. Accept the terms and click
   :guilabel:`Accept and create` button.

Create a Google Developer Console project
-----------------------------------------

4. The Google Maps Engine Connector uses the ``Google Maps Engine
   API`` to access the data stored in your account. You will need to obtain
   special credentials which the plugin will use to programatically access your
   data. Visit `Google Developer Console <https://console.developers.google.com/>`_
   and click :guilabel:`Create Project`. Enter ``GME Connector for
   QGIS API`` as the :guilabel:`PROJECT NAME` and ``gme-qgis-api`` as the
   :guilabel:`PROJECT ID`. These names are just a suggestion - you may use any
   name and id you like.

.. image:: /static/using_gme_connector/images/4.png

5. Once the project is created, click the :guilabel:`APIs & auth` link. Scroll
   down and find the :guilabel:`Google Maps Engine API`. Click the
   :guilabel:`OFF` button to toggle it to :guilabel:`ON`.

.. image:: /static/using_gme_connector/images/5.png
   :align: center

6. Next, click on the :guilabel:`Credentials` link. Click :guilabel:`CREATE NEW
   CLIEND ID` under the :guilabel:`OAuth` section.

   :align: center

7. In the :guilabel:`Create Client ID` dialog, select :guilabel:`Installed
   Application` as the :guilabel:`APPLICATION TYPE` and :guilabel:`Other` as
   the :guilabel:`INSTALLED APPLICATION TYPE`. Click :guilabel:`Create Client
   ID.`

.. image:: /static/using_gme_connector/images/7.png
   :align: center

8. Once the client id is created, you will see a new section called
   :guilabel:`Client ID for native application`. Note the :guilabel:`Client ID`
   and :guilabel:`Client secret`. These are the credentials you will need to use
   in QGIS.

.. image:: /static/using_gme_connector/images/8.png
   :align: center

9. Back in QGIS, visit :menuselection:`Plugins --> Manage and Install
   Plugins...`. Find the ``Google Maps Engine Connector`` plugin and
   click :guilabel:`Install plugin`.

.. image:: /static/using_gme_connector/images/9.png
   :align: center

10. Once the plugin is installed, you will see a new toolbar in QGIS. This
    toolbar contains various tools to work with Google Maps Engine. Click the
    :guilabel:`More` button.

.. image:: /static/using_gme_connector/images/10.png
   :align: center

11. In the :guilabel:`Advanced Settings` dialog, enter the :guilabel:`Client
    ID` and :guilabel:`Client Secret` you obtained from Google Developer
    Console. Click :guilabel:`OK`.

.. image:: /static/using_gme_connector/images/11.png
   :align: center

12. As you entered new API credentials, you will be prompted to log-in and
    authorize the plugin to use these. Sign-in to your Google account.

16. One of the features of the ``Google Maps Engine Connector`` plugin
    is the ability to upload datasets directly from QGIS. Select the
    ``SFMTA_Bikeway_Network`` layer and click :guilabel:`Upload` icon in the
    toolbar.

.. image:: /static/using_gme_connector/images/16.png
   :align: center

17. In the :guilabel:`Upload a dataset to Google Maps Engine` dialog, enter a
    :guilabel:`Description` of the dataset. You may leave all other settings to
    default values. Click :guilabel:`OK`.

.. image:: /static/using_gme_connector/images/17.png
   :align: center

18. The plugin will use the Google Maps Engine API to upload the layer and
    create a Google Maps Engine *Data Source*. Once the upload is finished, a
    new browser tab will open and take you to the newly created data source.

.. image:: /static/using_gme_connector/images/18.png

19. The next few steps will demonstrate the process of creating a map using
    Google Maps Engine. Once the map is created, we will access that map using
    the plugin in QGIS. Once your vector table has finished processing, click
    :guilabel:`Create styled layer`.

.. image:: /static/using_gme_connector/images/19.png
   :align: center

20. Name the layer as ``SFMTA_Bikeway_Network`` and click :guilabel:`Create`.

   :align: center

22. Choose the color and label options under the :guilabel:`Line style`
    section. Click :guilabel:`Apply` to view the style settings applied to your
    layer. You may also select :guilabel:`No Basemap` option from top-right
    corner to allow you to see your layer without the underlying basemap. Once
    you are satisfied with the styling, switch to the :guilabel:`Info windows`
    tab.

   :align: center

23. Here you can specify what content is shown when a feature is clicked on the
    map. You can access the feature attributes using the markup
    ``{attribute_name}``. In this case, we just want to display the street name
    for the line feature. Enter the following in the text area. Click
    :guilabel:`Apply` and click on any line feature on the map to test the info
    window code. When done, check the :guilabel:`Publish on exit` button and
    click :guilabel:`Exit`.
