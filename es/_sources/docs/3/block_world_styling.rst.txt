Creating a Block World Map (QGIS3)
==================================
*Contributed by:* `Steven Kim <https://geographyclub.github.io/>`_

In the previous tutorial :doc:`vector_styling_expressions` we looked at how simple expressions can be used to filter and style data in QGIS. We expand on this by creating a block world out of a hex grid with elevation values.

Overview of the task
--------------------
We will take a hex grid containing elevation values and use a mathematical function to set a height variable for the 2.5d renderer and a conditional statement to apply a color ramp.

Other skills you will learn
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Discovering and downloading elevation datasets.
- Creating a hexagonal grid and extracting raster statistics for each grid cell.
- Adding a new color ramp to QGIS.

Get the data
------------

`OpenTopography <https://opentopography.org/start>`_ provides access to many openly licensed elevation datasets. We will extract and download a DEM for your region of interest from a global DEM and Ocean Bathymetry dataset hosted on OpenTopography.

1. Visit the `Global Bathymetry and Topography at 15 Arc Sec: SRTM15+ V2.5.5 <https://portal.opentopography.org/raster?opentopoID=OTSRTM.122019.4326.1>`_ data page on OpenTopography website. This is a 500m resolution global dataset derived from SRTM DEM and various ocean bathymetry dataset.

3. Once the region is set, scroll down to the :guilabel:`2. Data Outputs Formats` section and select ``GeoTiff``. Leave all other options to default and scroll down to the :guilabel:`Job Description` section. Enter your email address to be notified when the download is ready. Click :guilabel:`SUBMIT` button.

4. The download may take a few minutes to get processed. Once ready, you will receive a link to download the selected subset. Download the file to your computer. The downloaded file is a tar compressed file that needs to be uncompressed to be opened in QGIS. On Windows, you may use an external program like `7-Zip <https://www.7-zip.org/>`_ to uncompress and extract the ``output_SRTM15Plus.tif`` file.

  .. image:: /static/3/block_world_styling/images/data4.png
    :align: center

5. In QGIS, locate the ``output_SRTM15Plus.tif`` file in the :guilabel:`Browser`. Drag and drop it to the QGIS Canvas. A new layer ``output_SRTM15Plus`` will be added to the :guilabel:`Layers` panel.

6. Open the Processing Toolbox from :menuselection:`Processing --> Toolbox`. Search and locate the :menuselection:`Vector creation --> Create grid` algorithm. Double-click to open it.

  .. image:: /static/3/block_world_styling/images/data6.png
    :align: center

7. In the :guilabel:`Create Grid` dialog, choose ``Hexagon`` as the :guilabel:`Grid type`. We will create a grid spanning the entire DEM. So for the :guilabel:`Grid extent`, click the down arrow and select :menuselection:`Calculate form Layer --> output_SRTM15Plus`.

  .. image:: /static/3/block_world_styling/images/data7.png
    :align: center

8. Our selected region is pretty big, so we can create a 1 degree grid. Select ``1`` for both :guilabel:`Horizontal spacing` and :guilabel:`Vertical spacing`. If you are working in a smaller region, you may choose a smaller grid spacing. Leave other options to their default values and click the :guilabel:`Run` button to create the grid.

  .. image:: /static/3/block_world_styling/images/data8.png
    :align: center

9. A new layer ``Grid`` will be added to the :guilabel:`Layers` panel. We will now extract the minimum, maximum and average elevation values in each grid polygon. Select the ``Grid`` layer and locate the :menuselection:`Raster analysis --> Zonal statistics` algorithm from the Processing Toolbox. Double-click to open it.

  .. image:: /static/3/block_world_styling/images/data9.png
    :align: center

10. Select ``Grid`` as the :guilabel:`Input layer` and ``output_SRTM15Plus`` as the :guilabel:`Raster layer`. Enter ``dem_`` as the :guilabel:`Output column prefix`. Next we want to configure what statistics we want to extract from the raster. Click the :guilabel:`...` button next to :guilabel:`Statistics to calculate`.

  .. image:: /static/3/block_world_styling/images/data10.png
    :align: center

11. Check the options for ``Mean``, ``Maximum`` and ``Minimum`` values and click :guilabel:`OK`. We will save the results to a file. Click the :guilabel:`...` button next to :guilabel:`Zonal Statistics` and select :guilabel:`Save to File...`.

  .. image:: /static/3/block_world_styling/images/data11.png
    :align: center

12. Browse to a folder on your computer and enter the file name as ``hex_grid_with_elevation``. Make sure the file type is selected as :guilabel:`GeoPackage files (*.gpkg)`. Click :guilabel:`Save`. Once the :guilabel:`Zonal Statistics` dialog is configured, click :guilabel:`Run`.

  .. image:: /static/3/block_world_styling/images/data12.png
    :align: center

13. The processing may take a few minutes depending on the size of your grid. Once the calculations are complete, a new layer ``hex_grid_with_elevation`` will be added to the :guilabel:`Layers` panel. This is a vector layer having attributes ``dem_mean``, ``dem_min`` and ``dem_max`` containing elevation statistics extracted from the DEM.

Procedure
---------

1. Locate the ``hex_grid_with_elevation.gpkg`` file in the QGIS Browser and expand it. Select the ``hex_grid_with_elevation`` layer and drag it to the canvas. 

  .. image:: /static/3/block_world_styling/images/1.png

    :align: center

5. Scroll down the color ramps until you find :guilabel:`wiki-1.02`. There may be several with the same name, just click on one and click :guilabel:`OK`.

  .. image:: /static/3/block_world_styling/images/5.png
    :align: center

6. At the :guilabel:`Save New Color Ramp` window, enter the value ``wiki-1.02`` as the :guilabel:`Name`.

8. Click on :guilabel:`Open Layer Styling Panel` and switch from :guilabel:`Single Symbol` to :guilabel:`2.5 D`. Click the :guilabel:`Îµ` button next to :guilabel:`Height`:

  .. image:: /static/3/block_world_styling/images/8.png
    :align: center

9. In the :guilabel:`Expression Builder`, enter the following expression. This expression uses ``scale_exp()`` function to change the range of the attribute values ``dem_mean`` from 0-10000 to 0-4 and to use an exponent of 2. The exponential scaling looks pretty in block world. The ``+8000`` is to make the bottom of the ocean equal zero.

  .. code-block:: none

     scale_exp(("dem_mean"+8000),0,10000,0,4,2)

    :align: center

12. You should see the topography of region begin to take shape. Click on :guilabel:`Open Layer Styling Panel` and switch from :guilabel:`2.5D` back to :guilabel:`Single Symbol`.

  .. image:: /static/3/block_world_styling/images/12.png
    :align: center

13. In the :guilabel:`Symbol` window, notice there are two Geometry Generators, each with a :guilabel:`Simple Fill` layer type. The first :guilabel:`Simple Fill` is the top face of each block, whereas the second :guilabel:`Simple Fill` is the side face.

  .. image:: /static/3/block_world_styling/images/13.png
    :align: center

14. Click on the first :guilabel:`Simple Fill` to change the color of the top face. Click on :guilabel:`Data define override` button for the :guilabel:`Fill color` and select :guilabel:`Edit...` on the menu.

  .. image:: /static/3/block_world_styling/images/14.png
    :align: center

15. This brings up the :guilabel:`Expression Builder` dialog for Fill color. Enter the following expression. This expression has a ``CASE`` conditional statement to use wiki-1.02 colors when value of the attribute ``dem_mean`` is greater than or equal to zero and green-blue colors when ``dem_mean`` is less than zero.  

  .. code-block:: none

     CASE 
     WHEN "dem_mean" >= 0 THEN ramp_color('wiki-1.02',scale_linear("dem_min",0,1500,0.4,1))
     ELSE ramp_color('GnBu',scale_linear("dem_mean",-6000,0,1,0))
     END
