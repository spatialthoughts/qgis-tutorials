Points in Polygon Analysis
==========================

.. note::

  In QGIS3, you can perform this analysis using the ``Join attributes by location (summary)`` tool in the Processing Toolbox. Use the polygon layer as the :guilabel:`Input Layer`, the point layer as the :guilabel:`Join layer` and ``count``  as the :guilabel:`Summaries to calculate`. See :doc:`3/performing_spatial_joins` tutorial for step-by-step instructions.
