=================================
.. note::

  If you are using QGIS3, there is a simpler and better way to do this analysis using the aggregate function. See my post `Find Neighbor Polygons using Summary Aggregate Function in QGIS <https://spatialthoughts.com/2019/05/23/neighbor-polygons-aggregate-qgis/>`_
