Running Processing Algorithms via Python (QGIS3)
================================================

The Processing Toolbox in QGIS contain an ever-growing collection of geoprocessing tools. The toolbox provides an easy batch processing interface to run any algorithm on a large number of inputs. See :doc:`batch_processing`. But there are cases where you need to incorporate a little bit of custom logic in your batch processing. As all the processing algorithms can be run programmatically via the Python API, you can run them via the Python Console. This tutorial shows how to run a processing algorithm via the Python Console to perform a custom geoprocessing task in just a few lines of code. Please review the :doc:`getting_started_with_pyqgis` tutorial to get familiar with the basics of the Python Scripting environment in QGIS.

Procedure
---------

1. Locate the ``PRISM_ppt_stable_4kmM3_2017_all_bil.zip`` folder in the QGIS Browser and expand it. The folder contains 12 individual layers for each month. Hold the :kbd:`Ctrl` key and select the ``.bil`` files for all 12 months. Once selected, drag them to the canvas.

.. note::

  The data is provided in the `BIL format <http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/raster-and-images/bil-bip-and-bsq-raster-files.htm>`_. Each layer is presented with a set of files ``.bil`` file containing the actual data, a ``.hdr`` file describing the data structure and a ``.prj`` file containing the projection information. QGIS can load the ``.bil`` file and provided the other files exist in the same directory.

2. A :guilabel:`Select Transformation of PRISM_ppt_stable_4kmM3_2017_all_bil` dialog box will appear, leave the selection to default and click :guilabel:`OK`.

3. Next, locate the ``Zip_Codes.zip`` folder and expand it. Drag the ``Zip_Codes.shp`` file to the canvas.

  .. image:: /static/3/processing_algorithms_pyqgis/images/3.png
     :align: center
     
4. Right-click the ``Zip_Codes`` layer and select :guilabel:`Zoom to Layer`. You will see the zip code polygons for the city of seattle and neighboring areas. 

  .. image:: /static/3/processing_algorithms_pyqgis/images/4.png
     :align: center
     
5. Go to :menuselection:`Processing --> Toolbox`.

  .. image:: /static/3/processing_algorithms_pyqgis/images/5.png
     :align: center
     
6. The algorithm to sample a raster layer using vector polygons is known as ``Zonal statistics``. Search for the algorithm in the :guilabel:`Processing Toolbox`. Select the algorithm and hover your mouse over it. You will see a tooltip with the text *Algorithm ID: 'native:zonalstatisticsfb'*. Note this id which will be needed  to call this algorithm via the Python API. Double-click the ``Zonal Statistics`` algorithm to launch it.

  .. image:: /static/3/processing_algorithms_pyqgis/images/6.png
     :align: center
     
7. We will do a manual test run of the algorithm for a single layer. This is a useful way to check if the algorithm behaves as expected and also an easy way to find out how to pass on relevant parameters to the algorithm when using it via Python. In the :guilabel:`Zonal Statistics` dialog, select ``Zip_Codes`` as the :guilabel:`Input layer` ``PRISM_ppt_stable_4kmM3_201701_bil`` as the :guilabel:`Raster Layer` and, leave other parameters to default. Click the :guilabel:`...` button next to :guilabel:`Statistics to calculate` and select only ``Mean``, next click the :guilabel:`...` button next to :guilabel:`Zonal Statistics` and save the layer as ``january_mean.gpkg`` Click :guilabel:`Run` .

  .. image:: /static/3/processing_algorithms_pyqgis/images/7.png
     :align: center
     
8. Once the algorithm finishes, switch to the :guilabel:`Log` tab. Make a note of the :guilabel:`Input Parameters` that were passed to the algorithm. Click :guilabel:`Close`.

  .. image:: /static/3/processing_algorithms_pyqgis/images/8.png
     :align: center
     
9. Now a new layer ``january_mean`` will be added to the canvas. Let's check the results, right-click on the layer and select :guilabel:`Open Attribute Table`. This particular algorithm modifies the input zone layer in-place and adds a new column for every statistic that was selected. As we had selected only ``Mean`` value, a new column named ``_mean`` is added to the table. The ``_`` was the default prefix. When we run the algorithm for layers of each month, it will be useful to specify a custom prefix with the month number so we can easily identify the mean values for each month (i.e. 01_mean, 02_mean etc.). Specifying this custom prefix is not possible in the Batch Processing interface of QGIS and if we ran this command using that interface, we would have to manually enter the custom prefix for each layer. If you are working with a large number of layers, this can be very cumbersome. Hence, we can add this custom logic using the Python API and run the algorithm in a for-loop for each layer.

10. Back in the main QGIS window, go to :menuselection:`Plugins --> Python Console`.

  .. image:: /static/3/processing_algorithms_pyqgis/images/10.png
     :align: center
     
11. Click on the :guilabel:`show editor` button. This will open the python editor where a bunch of python code can be written and executed with a single click of a button.

  .. image:: /static/3/processing_algorithms_pyqgis/images/11.png
     :align: center

12. To run the processing algorithm via Python, we need to access names of all the layers. Enter the following code in the editor and click on the :guilabel:`Play` button. You will see the names of all layers printed in the console.

  .. code-block:: python

    root = QgsProject.instance().layerTreeRoot()
    for layer in root.children():
      print(layer.name())

  .. image:: /static/3/processing_algorithms_pyqgis/images/12.png
     :align: center

13. Now, let's calculate the ``Mean`` for one month and create an output layer. In the below code :guilabel:`break` is used to exit the loop after the first execution, by this we can calculate the mean for January month. 

  .. code-block:: python

  
      import re

      root = QgsProject.instance().layerTreeRoot()

      input_layer = 'Zip_Codes'
      unique_field = 'OBJECTID'

      # Iterate through all raster layers
      for layer in root.children():
        if layer.name().startswith('PRISM'):
          # Run Zonal Stats algorithm
          # Extract the YYYYMM part of the layer name
          pattern = r'_(\d+)_'
          matches = re.findall(pattern, layer.name())
          # Use the month as the prefix
          prefix = matches[0][-2:] 
          params = {'INPUT_RASTER': layer.name(),
              'RASTER_BAND': 1, 'INPUT': input_layer,
              'COLUMN_PREFIX': prefix+'_', 'STATISTICS': [2],
              'OUTPUT': 'memory:'
              }
          result = processing.run("native:zonalstatisticsfb", params)

          result_layer = result['OUTPUT']
          QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(result_layer)
          # Breaking out of loop to demonstrate the
          # zonalstatistics algorithm.
          break

      
  .. image:: /static/3/processing_algorithms_pyqgis/images/13.png
     :align: center

.. note::

	You can also run a QGIS Processing algorithm via Python using the `processing.runAndLoadResults()` function instead of `processing.run()` as shown above - which will load the result to QGIS canvas directly.
	
14. A new layer ``output`` will be added to the canvas, right-click on the layer and select :guilabel:`Open Attribute Table`. :guilabel:`01_mean` represents one month mean, likewise the above algorithm will produce 12 new layers if executed without the break.

  .. image:: /static/3/processing_algorithms_pyqgis/images/14.png
     :align: center

15. Now lets add code to merge all the months mean, and create an single output layer from it. We update the previous code, to iteratively run the Zonal Statistics algorithm. We define a new variable ``result_layer`` which is set to ``Zip_Codes`` in the beginning but gets updated with the output layer from each iteration. This will allow us to use the result of each iteration and add new columns to it. Enter the following code to iterate over all raster layers and create an single layer containing all months mean. 

  .. code-block:: python

        import re

        root = QgsProject.instance().layerTreeRoot()

        input_layer = 'Zip_Codes'
        result_layer = input_layer
        unique_field = 'OBJECTID'

        # Iterate through all raster layers
        for layer in root.children():
          if layer.name().startswith('PRISM'):
            # Run Zonal Stats algorithm
            # Extract the YYYYMM part of the layer name
            pattern = r'_(\d+)_'
            matches = re.findall(pattern, layer.name())
            # Use the month as the prefix
            prefix = matches[0][-2:] 
            params = {'INPUT_RASTER': layer.name(),
                'RASTER_BAND': 1, 'INPUT': result_layer,
                'COLUMN_PREFIX': prefix+'_', 'STATISTICS': [2],
                'OUTPUT': 'memory:'
                }
            result = processing.run("native:zonalstatisticsfb", params)

            # Update the result_layer variable
            # The result will be used as input for the next iteration
            result_layer = result['OUTPUT']

        QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(result_layer)

        

  .. image:: /static/3/processing_algorithms_pyqgis/images/15.png
     :align: center
     
16. Once the processing finishes, a new layer ``output`` will be added to canvas, right-click on the layer and select :guilabel:`Open Attribute Table`.

  .. image:: /static/3/processing_algorithms_pyqgis/images/16.png
     :align: center
     
17. You will see 12 new columns added to the table with custom prefixes and mean precipitation values extracted from the raster layers.
