Locating Nearest Facility with Origin-Destination Matrix (QGIS3)
================================================================

In the previous tutorial, :doc:`basic_network_analysis`, we learned how to build a network and calculate the shortest path between 2 points. We can apply that technique to many different types of network-based analysis. One such application is to compute **Origin-Destination Matrix** or **OD Matrix**. Given a set of origin points and another set of destination points, we can calculate the shortest path between each origin-destination pairs and find out the travel distance/time between them. Such analysis is useful to locate the closest facility to any given point. For example, a logistics company may use this analysis to find the closest warehouse to their customers to optimize delivery routes. Here we use the Distance Matrix algorithm from **QGIS Network Analysis Toolbox (QNEAT3)** plugin to find the nearest health facility to each address in the city.

.. note::

  This tutorial shows how to use your own network data to compute an origin-destination matrix. If you do not have your own network data, you can use **ORS Tools Plugin** and algorithm :menuselection:`ORS Tools --> Matrix -->  Matrix from Layers` to do a similar analysis using OpenStreetMap data. See :doc:`service_area_analysis` to learn how to use ORS Tools plugin.

Procedure
---------

1. Locate the downloaded ``Roadway_Block-shp.zip`` file in the :guilabel:`Browser` panel. Expand it and drag the ``Roadway_Block.shp`` file to the canvas. Similarly, locate the ``Adult_Mental_Health_Providers.zip`` file, expand it and add ``Adult_Mental_Health_Providers.shp`` to the canvas.

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/1.png
    :align: center
  
2. Next, locate the ``Address_Points.zip`` file, expand it and add the ``Address_Points.shp``. You will see a lot of points around the city. Each point represents a valid address. We will select 1000 points randomly. This technique is called random sampling. Go to :menuselection:`Processing --> Toolbox`.

3. Search for and locate the :menuselection:`Vector Selection --> Random extract` algorithm.

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/3.png
    :align: center
  
4. Select ``Address_Points`` as the :guilabel:`Input layer`, ``Number of feature`` as the :guilabel:`Method` and, enter ``1000`` in the :guilabel:`Number/percentage of features`. In the :guilabel:`Extracted (random)` choose the ``...``  and click :guilabel:`Save to a file`. Now choose the directory and enter the name as ``address_point_subset.shp`` and click :guilabel:`Run`. 

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/4.png
    :align: center

.. note::

   As the algorithm will extract 1000 random points from the given data set, to replicate the exact points used in this exercise you can download the subset file which we got during the execution of the algorithm here `address_point_subset.zip <https://www.qgistutorials.com/downloads/address_point_subset.zip>`_ . After downloading load ``address_point_subset.shp`` layer into QGIS. 

  
5. A new layer ``address_point_subset`` will be added to the :guilabel:`Layers` panel, you can turn off the visibility of ``Address_Points`` address points layer.

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/5.png
    :align: center
  
6. Right-click on the ``address_point_subset`` layer and select :guilabel:`Rename layer`.

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/6.png
    :align: center
  
7. Let's rename this layer as ``origin_points``. Similarly, rename the ``Adult_Mental_Health_Providers`` layers representing the health facilities as ``destination_points``. Naming the layers this way makes it easy to identify them in subsequent processing.

    :align: center
  
8. Locate the :menuselection:`QNEAT3 --> Distance matrices --> OD Matrix from Layers as Line (m:n)` algorithm. If you do not see this algorithm in the toolbox, make sure you have installed the **QNEAT3** plugin.

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/8.png
    :align: center
  
9. This algorithm helps find the distances along with the network between selected origin and destination layers. Select ``Roadway_Block`` as the :guilabel:`Network layer`. Select ``origin_points`` as the :guilabel:`From-Points layer` and ``OBJECTID_1`` as the :guilabel:`Unique Point ID field`. Similarly, set ``destination_points`` as the :guilabel:`To-Points Layer` and ``OBJECTID`` as  the :guilabel:`Unique Point ID field`. Set the :guilabel:`Optimization Criterion` as ``Shortest Path (distance optimization)``.

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/9.png
    :align: center
  
10. As many streets in the network are one-way, we need to set the :guilabel:`Advanced parameters` to specify the direction. See :doc:`basic_network_analysis` for more details on how these attributes are structured. Choose ``SUMMARYDIR`` as the :guilabel:`Direction field`. Enter ``OB`` as the :guilabel:`Value for the forward direction`, ``IB`` as the :guilabel:`Value for backward direction`, and ``BD`` as the :guilabel:`Value for the both direction`. Set the :guilabel:`Topology tolerance` as ``0.0000150``. Keep other options to their default values and click :guilabel:`Run`.

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/10.png
    :align: center
  
11. A new table layer called ``Output OD Matrix`` will be added to the :guilabel:`Layers` panel. Right-click and select :guilabel:`Open Attributes Table`. You will see that the table contains *13000* rows. We had 13 origin points and 1000 destination points - so the output contains *13x1000 = 13000* pairs of origins and destination. The ``total_cost`` column contains distance in meters between each origin point to every destination point. 

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/11.png
    :align: center
  
12. For this tutorial, we are interested in only the destination point with the shortest distance. We can create a SQL query to pick the destination with the least ``total_cost`` among all destinations. Go to :menuselection:`Processing --> Toolbox`.

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/12.png
    :align: center
  
13. Search for and locate the :menuselection:`Vector general --> Execute SQL`, select ``...`` in :guilabel:`Additional input data sources` check the :guilabel:`Output OD Matrix` and, click :guilabel:`OK`. Now click the :guilabel:`Summation` under :guilabel:`SQL query`.

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/13.png
    :align: center
  
14. Enter the following query in :guilabel:`SQL query` dialog box. Enter ``geometry`` as the :guilabel:`Geometry field` and, select ``LineString`` as the :guilabel:`Geometry type`. Click :guilabel:`Run`.

  .. code-block:: none

    select origin_id, destination_id, min(total_cost) as shortest_distance, geometry 
    from input1 group by origin_id

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/14.png
    :align: center
  
15. A new virtual layer ``SQL Output`` will be added to the :guilabel:`Layers` panel. This Layer has the result of our analysis. Nearest Adult mental health center for each of the 1000 origin points. Let's try a few different ways to visualize and validate these results. 

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/15.png
    :align: center

16. To validate this let us build the Shortest path. The point *(OBJECTID_1 = 853046)* is visually near to Health center *(OBJECTID = 3)*, but from the SQL query it is connected to health center *(OBJECTID = 9)*. Let's validate this by finding the actual distance between these origins and destination. First, let's run the shortest path algorithm on 1 pair. Locate the :menuselection:`QNEAT3 --> Routing --> Shortest path (point to point)` algorithm and launch it.

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/16.png
    :align: center
  
17. Select ``Roadway_Block`` as the :guilabel:`Network Layer`. To pick a start and endpoint. You can click the :guilabel:`...` button next to the :guilabel:`Start point` and click on the origin point *(OBJECTID_1 = 853046)* in the canvas. Similarly, select the destination point *(OBJECTID = 3)* as the :guilabel:`End point`. Keep the :guilabel:`Optimization Criterion` as ``Shortest Path (distance optimization)``. Expand the :guilabel:`Advanced parameter` section. Choose ``SUMMARYDIR`` as the :guilabel:`Direction field`. Enter ``OB`` as the :guilabel:`Value for forward direction` and ``IB`` as the :guilabel:`Value for backward direction`. Set the :guilabel:`Topology tolerance` as ``0.000015``. Keep other options to their default values and click :guilabel:`Run`. Now change the destination point *(OBJECTID = 9)* in the :guilabel:`End point` and click :guilabel:`Run`

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/17.png
    :align: center
  
18. Two new layers ``Shortest Path Layer`` will be added to the :guilabel:`Layers` panel. You will see that although the destination point *(OBJECTID = 9)* visually is closed to the origin point, the actual distance is longer when compared to the destination point *(OBJECTID = 3)*. 

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/18.png
    :align: center

19. Note that even though the lines connecting the origin and destination is a straight-line, the destination was found using the distance along with the network. It will be much useful visualization to show the actual shortest-path between each origin-destination. As of now, there is no easy way to generate the shortest-path between multiple origin-destination pairs the way we generated the distance matrix. But I will demonstrate a way to use some python scripting to generate this visualization. First, let's run the shortest path algorithm on 1 pair. Locate the :menuselection:`QNEAT3 --> Routing --> Shortest path (point to point)` algorithm and launch it.

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/19.png
    :align: center

20. In the :guilabel:`Shortest Path (Point to Point)` dialog, select ``Roadway_Block`` as the :guilabel:`Network Layer`. Keep the :guilabel:`Optimization criteria` as Shortest Path (distance optimization). Next we need to pick a start and end point. You can click the :guilabel:`...` button next to :guilabel:`Start point` and click on the origin point in the canvas. Similarly select the destination point as the :guilabel:`End point`. Expand the :guilabel:`Advanced parameter` section. Choose ``SUMMARYDIR`` as the :guilabel:`Direction field`. Enter ``OB`` as the :guilabel:`Value for forward direction` and ``IB`` as the :guilabel:`Value for backward direction`. In :guilabel:`Topology tolerance` enter ``0.000015``. Keep other options to their default values and click :guilabel:`Run`.

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/20.png
    :align: center

21. A new layer ``Shortest Path`` Layer will be added to the :guilabel:`Layers` panel. You will see that this path follows the network rather than connecting the origin and destination with a straight line. The reason we ran the algorithm on 1 pair is to easily identify the parameter values that we can use in our script. Select ``Shortest Path layer``, right-click and select :guilabel:`Remove Layer`. Click the :guilabel:`History` button in the :guilabel:`Processing Toolbox`.

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/21.png
    :align: center

22. In the :guilabel:`History` dialog, Select the latest command(command used for Shortest path). This command displays all the parameters and their values that we used. We can now take these values and put them in a script that can allow us to run this command on many origin-destination pairs. Click :guilabel:`Close`.

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/22.png
    :align: center

23. In the :guilabel:`Processing Toolbox`, click the :guilabel:`scripts` button and select :guilabel:`Create New script`.  

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/23.png
    :align: center

24. In the :guilabel:`Processing Script Editor`, copy/paste the below code. Save the file as ``get_routes_from_matrix.py``. Now close the :guilabel:`Processing Script Editor`. If you are using a different dataset than the one used in this tutorial, you will have to update the script with the parameter values from step 22.


  .. literalinclude:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/scripts/matrix_to_routes.py

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/24.png
    :align: center

25. Now we can test the script. Select a few connections for the layer ``SQL Output`` for which you want the actual routes computed. In the :guilabel:`Processing Toolbox`, a new dropdown :guilabel:`Scripts` will be added. Click on it and select ``Get Routes from Matrix``.

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/25.png
    :align: center

.. note::

	This script needs to compute the network graph for each iteration and thus quite slow. If you have a lot of origin-destination pairs, it can take time.
	
26. In the :guilabel:`Network Layer` select ``Roadway_Block`` and in the :guilabel:`Distance Matrix layer` select ``SQL Output`` then check selected features only. Click :guilabel:`Run`.

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/26.png
    :align: center

27. A new layer ``Network Routes`` will be added to the :guilabel:`Layers` panel. This will contain the actual route to the destination.
