Introduction
============

`QGIS <http://qgis.org>`_ is a popular open-source GIS with advanced
capabilities. This website contains a series of tutorials and tips that show you how to use it to tackle common GIS problems. You may use these tutorials as a self-paced course to learn the software thoroughly. However, each section is fairly independent, so those familiar with QGIS can jump into any section.

You can also check out :doc:`learning_resources` for other materials to help you
learn QGIS.

This tutorials are written and maintained by `Ujaval Gandhi <https://twitter.com/spatialthoughts>`_, with translations and contributions from the global QGIS community.
