Importing Spreadsheets or CSV files
===================================

.. warning:: 

  This tutorial is now obsolete. A new and updated version is available at :doc:`3/importing_spreadsheets_csv`
   
Many times the GIS data comes in a table or an Excel spreadsheet. Also, if you have a list lat/long coordinates, you can easily import this data in your GIS project.

Overview of the task
--------------------

We will be importing a text file of earthquake data to QGIS. 

Get the data
------------

NOAAâ€™s National Geophysical Data Center produces a great dataset of all significant earthquakes since 2150 BC. `Learn more. <http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/form?t=101650&s=1&d=1>`_

Download `Significant Earthquake Database <http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/results?type_0=Exact&query_0=$ID&t=101650&s=13&d=189&dfn=signif.txt>`_ text file.

For convenience, you may directly download a copy of both the datasets from the links
below:

`signif.txt <http://www.qgistutorials.com/downloads/signif.txt>`_

Data Source [NCEI]_

Procedure
---------

1. Examine your tabular data source. To import this data to QGIS, you will have to save it as a text file and need at least 2 columns which contain the X and Y coordinates. If you have a spreadsheet, use `Save As` function in your program to save it as a `Tab Delimited File` or a `Comma Separated Values (CSV)` file. Once you have the data exported this way, you can open it in a text editor such as Notepad to view the contents. In case of the Significant Earthquake Database, the data already comes as a text file which contains latitude and longitude of the earthquake centers along with other related attributes. You will see that each field is separated by a TAB.

2. Open QGIS. Click on :menuselection:`Layers --> Add Delimited Text Layer`.

3. In the :guilabel:`Create a Layer from a Delimited Text File` dialog, click on :guilabel:`Browse` and specify the path to the text file you downloaded. In the :guilabel:`File format` section, select :guilabel:`Custom delimiters` and check :guilabel:`Tab`. The :guilabel:`Geometry definition` secction will be auto-populated if it finds a suitable X and Y coordinate fields. In our case they are *LONGITUDE* and *LATITUDE*. You may change it if the import selects the wrong fields. Click :guilabel:`OK`.

.. note::

   It is easy to confuse X and Y coordinates. Latitude specifies the north-south position of a point and hence it is a **Y** coordinate. Similarly Longitude specifies the east-west position of a point and it is a **X** coordinate.

4. You may see some errors displayed in the next dialog. The erros in this file are mainly due to missing X or Y fields. You may examine these errors and fix the problems in your source file. For this tutorial, you may ignore these errors.

5. Next, a :guilabel:`Coordinate Reference System Selector` will ask you to select a coordinate reference system. Since the earthquake coordinates are in latitudes and longitudes, you should select `WGS 84`. Click :guilabel:`OK`.

6. You will now see that the data will be imported and displayed in the QGIS canvas.
