Styling Contours in 3D (QGIS3)
==============================
*Contributed by:* `Steven Kim <https://geographyclub.github.io/>`_

In the previous tutorial, :doc:`river_styling_expressions` we used expressions to filter and style a river network. In this tutorial, we will work with a contour dataset and style it using expressions to give it a 3D effect.

Overview of the task
--------------------

We will use a geometry generator symbol layer to dynamically apply an offset to the contours and then apply a color ramp to create an appearance of a 3d map.

Get the data
------------

`The National Map <https://www.usgs.gov/programs/national-geospatial-program/national-map>`_ is a collaborative effort among the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and other partners to improve and deliver topographic information for the Nation. We will download a contour dataset from The National Map downloader.


1. Visit the `TNM Download v2 <https://apps.nationalmap.gov/downloader/>`_. Browse to your region of interest. For this tutorial, we will be downloading the contours for a region around Austin, Texas.

2. On the downloader, look for the ``Elevation Products(3DEP)`` dataset and check the box to see all subcategories. Select only the ``Contours (1:24,000-scale)`` category. Under :guilabel:`File Formats`, select ``GeoPackage``.

3. Click the blue button :guilabel:`Search Products` to see the list of matching files.

4. In the results, you will find the ``USGS NED 1/3 arc-second Contours for Austin E, Texas`` file. Click on :guilabel:`Download Link(ZIP)` to download the zipped GeoPackage file ``ELEV_Austin_E_TX_1X1_GPKG.zip``.

You can directly download the zip file at `ELEV_Austin_E_TX_1X1_GPKG.zip <https://prd-tnm.s3.amazonaws.com/StagedProducts/Contours/GPKG/ELEV_Austin_E_TX_1X1_GPKG.zip>`_

.. note::

    You can also generate contours from any DEM layer and use it instead of the contours used here. Refer to our tutorial :doc:`working_with_terrain` for step-by-step instructions.
    
Procedure
---------

1. Unzip the `ELEV_Austin_E_TX_1X1_GPKG.zip` file on your computer. Locate the resulting `ELEV_Austin_E_TX_1X1_GPKG.gpkg` file in the :guilabel:`QGIS Browser` and expand it. Select the `Elev_Contour` layer and drag it to the canvas.

2. A new layer `Elev_Contour` will now be loaded and you should see the contour lines.

3. Right-click the `Elev_Contour` layer and choose :guilabel:`Open Attribute Table`. You will notice that the field ``contourelevation`` contains the elevation value for each contour line. This field name is important and is used in the expressions in subsequent steps.

4. We are now ready to style the contours. Before continuing, we must first add a color ramp suitable for coloring elevation. If you already have added the `wiki-1.02` color ramp for our previous tutorial :doc:`block_world_styling`, you can skip to Step 9. Click on :guilabel:`Settings` in the menubar and select :guilabel:`Style Manager`.

5. Click on the plus sign :guilabel:`Add item` at the bottom and select :menuselection:`Catalog: cpt-city...`.

  .. image:: /static/3/contour_3d_styling/images/5.png
    :align: center

6. Scroll down the color ramps until you find :guilabel:`wiki-1.02`. There may be several with the same name, just click on one and click :guilabel:`OK`.

  .. image:: /static/3/contour_3d_styling/images/6.png
    :align: center

7. At the :guilabel:`Save New Color Ramp` window, enter the value ``wiki-1.02`` as the :guilabel:`Name`.

  .. image:: /static/3/contour_3d_styling/images/7.png
    :align: center

8. Click :guilabel:`Save` to exit the window, then click :guilabel:`Close` to exit Style Manager. Now the wiki-1.02 color ramp is available to use in your projects going forward.

9. Now we can style the contours. Select the ``Elev_Contour`` layer and click on the button :guilabel:`Open Layer Styling Panel`. Select :guilabel:`Simple Line` to access its properties.

10. Switch `Symbol layer type` from :guilabel:`Simple Line` to :guilabel:`Geometry Generator`. This symbol layer allows us to dynamically change the geometry of features in the layer using an expression.

  .. image:: /static/3/contour_3d_styling/images/10.png
    :align: center

11. In the input box, enter this expression to translate each contour line in the y-axis by its elevation value. We use the ``minimum()`` and ``maximum()`` functions to find the range of values in the **contourelevation** column and the `scale_linear()` function to scale the elevation linearly from the minimum to the maximum to the desired y-offset range between 0 to 0.2 degrees. If your contour layer is in a CRS that has units other than degrees, make sure to adjust these values appropriately. Enter the expression and click :guilabel:`OK`.

  .. code-block:: none
 
    translate($geometry,0,scale_linear("contourelevation",
    minimum("contourelevation"),maximum("contourelevation"),0,0.2))
  
  .. image:: /static/3/contour_3d_styling/images/11.png
    :align: center

12. Below `Geometry Generator` in the symbol window, select the :guilabel:`Simple Line` layer to access it's properties. Click on the :guilabel:`Data define override` button for :guilabel:`Color` and select the :guilabel:`Edit` menu.

  .. image:: /static/3/contour_3d_styling/images/12.png
    :align: center

13. This brings up the :guilabel:`Expression Builder` dialog for the color of the line. Enter this expression to color contour lines by **contourelevation** value from the *wiki-1.02* color ramp. We need to map the elevation values to the range expected by the color ramp (0 to 1). Instead of `scale_linear` function used earlier, we use the `scale_polynomial` function to scale the values in a non-linear way. Once the expression is entered, click :guilabel:`OK`.

  .. code-block:: none
    
    ramp_color('wiki-1.02',scale_polynomial("contourelevation",
    minimum("contourelevation"),maximum("contourelevation"),
    0,1,0.5))

14. You should see a 3D representation of the contours colored by elevation. Experiment with the coloring and scaling expressions to reveal different artistic representations of the landscape.
