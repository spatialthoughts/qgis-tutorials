Locating Nearest Facility with Origin-Destination Matrix (QGIS3)
================================================================

In the previous tutorial, :doc:`basic_network_analysis`, we learned how to build a network and calculate the shortest path between 2 points. We can apply that technique to many different types of network-based analysis. One such application is to compute **Origin-Destination Matrix** or **OD Matrix**. Given a set of origin points and another set of destination points, we can calculate the shortest path between each origin-destination pairs and find out the travel distance/time between them. Such analysis is useful to locate the closest facility to any given point. For example, a logistics company may use this analysis to find the closest warehouse to their customers to optimize delivery routes. Here we use the Distance Matrix algorithm from **QGIS Network Analysis Toolbox (QNEAT3)** plugin to find the nearest health facility to each address in the city.

.. note::

  This tutorial shows how to use your own network data to compute an origin-destination matrix. If you do not have your own network data, you can use **ORS Tools Plugin** and algorithm :menuselection:`ORS Tools --> Matrix -->  Matrix from Layers` to do a similar analysis using OpenStreetMap data. See :doc:`service_area_analysis` to learn how to use ORS Tools plugin.

Overview of the task
--------------------

We will take 2 layers for Washington DC - one with points representing addresses and another with points representing mental health facilities - and find out the facility with the least travel distance from each address.

Procedure
---------

1. Locate the ``Community_Based_Service_Providers.zip`` file, expand it and add ``Community_Based_Service_Providers.shp`` to the canvas. We will select only those centres providing facilities to adults. Right-click on the ``Community_Based_Service_Providers.shp`` layer and select :guilabel:`Filter`.

2. It will open a :guilabel:`Query Builder` dialog box. Enter the following query in the :guilabel:` Filter Expression`  Click :guilabel:`Run`.

  .. code-block:: none

    "PROVIDER_T"  IN ('Adult','Adult & Child')

    :align: center
  
3. Next, locate the ``Roadway_Block.zip`` file, expand it and add the ``Roadway_Block.shp``. Similarly, locate the ``Address_Points.zip`` file, expand it and add the ``Address_Points.shp``. You will see a lot of points around the city. Each point represents a valid address. We will select 1000 points randomly. This technique is called random sampling. Go to :menuselection:`Processing --> Toolbox`.

4. Search for and locate the :menuselection:`Vector Selection --> Random extract` algorithm.

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/3.png
    :align: center
  
5. Select ``Address_Points`` as the :guilabel:`Input layer`, ``Number of feature`` as the :guilabel:`Method` and, enter ``1000`` in the :guilabel:`Number/percentage of features`. In the :guilabel:`Extracted (random)` choose the ``...``  and click :guilabel:`Save to a file`. Now choose the directory and enter the name as ``address_point_subset.shp`` and click :guilabel:`Run`.

.. note::

   As the algorithm will extract 1000 random points from the given data set, to replicate the exact points used in this exercise you can download the subset file which we got during the execution of the algorithm here `address_point_subset.zip <https://www.qgistutorials.com/downloads/address_point_subset.zip>`_ . After downloading load ``address_point_subset.shp`` layer into QGIS. 
 
6. A new layer ``address_point_subset`` will be added to the :guilabel:`Layers` panel, you can turn off the visibility of ``Address_Points`` address points layer. Let's rename this layer as ``origin_points``. Right-click on the ``address_point_subset`` layer and select :guilabel:`Rename layer`.

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/6.png
    :align: center
  
7. Similarly, rename the ``Community_Based_Service_Provider`` layers representing the health facilities as ``destination_points``. Naming the layers this way makes it easy to identify them in subsequent processing. Further we will open processing toolbox to create the distance matrix using origin and destination layers.

8. Locate the :menuselection:`QNEAT3 --> Distance matrices --> OD Matrix from Layers as Line (m:n)` algorithm. If you do not see this algorithm in the toolbox, make sure you have installed the **QNEAT3** plugin.

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/8.png
    :align: center
  
9. This algorithm helps find the distances along with the network between selected origin and destination layers. Select ``Roadway_Block`` as the :guilabel:`Network layer`. Select ``origin_points`` as the :guilabel:`From-Points layer` and ``OBJECTID`` as the :guilabel:`Unique Point ID field`. Similarly, set ``destination_points`` as the :guilabel:`To-Points Layer` and ``OBJECTID`` as  the :guilabel:`Unique Point ID field`. Set the :guilabel:`Optimization Criterion` as ``Shortest Path (distance optimization)``.

10. As many streets in the network are one-way, we need to set the :guilabel:`Advanced parameters` to specify the direction. See :doc:`basic_network_analysis` for more details on how these attributes are structured. We also have an option to select geometry style of the generated matrix. We are having a road network with direction information so we can generate matrix by folling the route. Choose ``Matrix geometry follows routes``. Choose ``SUMMARYDIR`` as the :guilabel:`Direction field`. Enter ``OB`` as the :guilabel:`Value for the forward direction`, ``IB`` as the :guilabel:`Value for backward direction`, and ``BD`` as the :guilabel:`Value for the both direction`. Set the :guilabel:`Topology tolerance` as ``0.0000150``. Keep other options to their default values and click :guilabel:`Run`.

    :align: center
  
11. A new table layer called ``Output OD Matrix`` will be added to the :guilabel:`Layers` panel. Right-click and select :guilabel:`Open Attributes Table`. You will see that the table contains *67000* rows. We had 67 origin points and 1000 destination points - so the output contains *67x1000 = 67000* pairs of origins and destination. The ``total_cost`` column contains distance in meters between each origin point to every destination point.

12. For this tutorial, we are interested in only the destination point with the shortest distance. We can create a SQL query to pick the destination with the least ``total_cost`` among all destinations. Go to :menuselection:`Processing --> Toolbox`.Search for and locate the :menuselection:`Vector general --> Execute SQL`.

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/12.png
    :align: center
  
13. In :guilabel:`Additional input data sources` select ``...`` and check the :guilabel:`Output OD Matrix` and, click :guilabel:`OK`. Now click the :guilabel:`Summation` under :guilabel:`SQL query`. Enter the following query in :guilabel:`SQL query` dialog box. Enter ``geometry`` as the :guilabel:`Geometry field` and, select ``LineString`` as the :guilabel:`Geometry type`. Click :guilabel:`Run`.

  .. code-block:: none

    select origin_id, destination_id, min(total_cost) as shortest_distance, geometry 
    from input1 group by origin_id

  .. image:: /static/3/origin_destination_matrix/images/13.png
    :align: center
  
14. A new virtual layer ``SQL Output`` will be added to the :guilabel:`Layers` panel. This Layer has the result of our analysis. Nearest service provider for each of the 1000 origin points.
