Automating Complex Workflows using Processing Modeler
=====================================================
.. warning:: 

   A new version of this tutorial is available at :doc:`3/processing_graphical_modeler`
	 
GIS Workflows typically involve many steps - with each step generating
intermediate output that is used by the next step. If you change the input data
or want to tweak a parameter, you will need to run through the entire process
again manually.  Fortunately, QGIS has a graphical modeler built-in that can
help you define your workflow and run it with a single invocation. You can also
run these workflows as a batch over a large number of inputs.

Overview of the task
--------------------

This tutorial shows how to build a model to extract areas for a particular
class from a classified land use raster.

Get the data
------------

We will use the `Global Mosaics of the standard MODIS land cover type data
product <http://www.landcover.org/data/lc/>`_ from `Global Land Cover
Facility (GLCF) <http://www.landcover.org/>`_ as an example.

.. warning::

Procedure
---------

Our workflow for this exercise will have the following steps.

* Apply a ``Majority Filter`` algorithm to the input landcover raster. This
  will reduce noise in our output by eliminating isolated pixels.
* Convert the resulting raster to a polygon layer.
* Query for a class value from the attribute table of the polygon layer and
  create a vector layer for that class.

The following steps outline the process to code the above process into a model
and run it on the downloaded datasets.

1. Launch QGIS and go to :menuselection:`Processing --> Graphical Modeler...`.

2. The :guilabel:`Processing modeler` dialog contains a left-hand panel and a
   main canvas. Select the :guilabel:`Inputs` tab in the left-hand panel and
   drag the :guilabel:`+ Raster layer` to the canvas.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/2.png
   :align: center

3. A :guilabel:`Parameter definition` dialog will pop-up. Enter ``Input`` as
   the :guilabel:`Parameter name` and mark ``Yes`` to :guilabel:`Required`.
   Click :guilabel:`OK`.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/3.png
   :align: center

4. You will see a box with the name :guilabel:`Input` appear in the canvas.
   This represents the landcover raster that we will use as input. Next step
   is to apply a ``Majority filter`` algorithm. Switch to the
   :guilabel:`Algorithm` tab from the bottom-left corner. Search for the
   algorithm and you will find it listed under :guilabel:`SAGA` provider. Drag
   it to the canvas.

.. note::

   If you do not see this algorithm or any of the subsequent algorithms
   mentioned in thi tutorial, you may be using the :guilabel:`Simplified
   Interface` of the Processing Toolbox. Switch to the :guilabel:`Advanced
   Interface` by using the dropdown at the bottom of the Processing
   Toolbox in the main QGIS window.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/4.png
   :align: center

5. A configuration dialog for :guilabel:`Majority Filter` will be presented.
   Leave the values to their default and click :guilabel:`OK`.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/5.png
   :align: center

6. You will note that there is now a new box named :guilabel:`Majority Filter`
   in the canvas and it is connected to the :guilabel:`Input` box. This is
   because the :guilabel:`Majority Filter` algorithm uses the :guilabel:`Input`
   raster as its input. The next step in our workflow is to convert the output
   of majority filter to vector. Find the ``Polygonize (raster to vector)``
   algorithm and drag it to the canvas.

.. note::

   The boxes can be moved and arranged by clicking on it and dragging it while
   holding the left mouse button. You can also use the scroll-wheel to zoom in
   and out in the model canvas.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/6.png
   :align: center

7. Select 'Filtered Grid' from algorithm 'Majority Filter' as the value for
   :guilabel:`Input layer`. Click :guilabel:`OK`.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/7.png
   :align: center

8. The final step in the workflow is to query for a class value and create a
   new layer from the matching features. Search for the ``Extract by
   attribute`` algorithm and drag it the canvas.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/8.png
   :align: center

9. Select 'Vectorized' from algorithm 'Polygonize (raster to vector) as the
   :guilabel:`Input Layer`. We want to extract the pixels that represent
   Croplands. The corresponding pixel value for this class will be 12. (see
   `Code Values <http://www.landcover.org/data/lc/>`_). Enter ``DN`` as the
   :guilabel:`Selection attribute` and ``12`` as the :guilabel:`value`. As the
   output of this operation will be the final result, we need to name the
   output. Enter ``vectorized class`` as the :guilabel:`Output`.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/9.png
   :align: center

10. Enter the :guilabel:`Model name` as ``vectorize`` and :guilabel:`Group
    name` as ``raster``. Click the :guilabel:`Save` button.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/10.png
   :align: center

11. Name the model ``vectorize`` and click :guilabel:`Save`.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/11.png
   :align: center

12. Now it is time to test our model. Close the modeler and switch to the main
    QGIS window. Go to :menuselection:`Layer --> Add Layer --> Add Raster
    Layer...`.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/12.png
   :align: center

13. Browse to the downloaded ``LC_hd_global_2001.tif.gz`` file and click
    :guilabel:`Open`. Once the raster is loaded, go to
    :menuselection:`Processing --> Toolbox`.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/13.png
   :align: center

14. Find the newly created model under :menuselection:`Models --> raster -->
    vectorize`. Double-click to launch the model.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/14.png
   :align: center

15. Select ``LC_hd_global_2001`` as the :guilabel:`Input` and click
    :guilabel:`Run`.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/15.png
   :align: center

16. You will see all the steps being executed without any user input. Once the
    processing finishes, a new layer ``vectorized_class`` will be added to
    QGIS. Let's improve the model a little bit. Right-click on the
    ``vectorize`` model and select :guilabel:`Edit model`.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/16.png
   :align: center

17. In Step 12, we hard-coded the value ``12`` as the class value. Instead, we
    can specify it as a input parameter which the user can change. To add this,
    switch to the :guilabel:`Inputs` tab and drag the :guilabel:`+ String` to
    the model.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/17.png
   :align: center

18. Enter the :guilabel:`Parameter Name` as ``Class``. Enter ``12`` as the
    :guilabel:`Default value`.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/18.png
   :align: center

19. We will now change the ``Extract by attribute`` algorithm to use this input
    instead of the hard-coded value. Click the :guilabel:`Edit` button next to
    the :guilabel:`Extract by attribute` box.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/19.png
   :align: center

20. Click the dropdown arrow for :guilabel:`Value` and select ``Class``. Click
    :guilabel:`OK`.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/20.png
   :align: center

21. You will see from the model diagram that the :guilabel:`Extract by
    attribute` algorithm now uses 2 inputs. The modeler has a shortcut to
    launch the model and test it. Click the :guilabel:`Run` button from the
    toolbar.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/21.png
   :align: center

22. Notice that the model dialog has a new editable field called
    :guilabel:`Class`. Enter ``16`` as the :guilabel:`Class` value and click
    :guilabel:`Run`.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/22.png
   :align: center

23. Once the processing finishes, you will see that with just a click of a
    button we were able to run a complex workflow and extract the area for
    class 16.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/23.png
   :align: center

24. Now that our model is ready, we can run it just as easily on a new raster
    layer. Load the ``LC_hd_global_2012.tif.gz`` file by going to
    :menuselection:`Layer --> Add Layer --> Add Raster Layer...`. Click the
    :guilabel:`vectorize`` model from the :guilabel:`Processing Toolbox` panel.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/24.png
   :align: center

25. Pick the ``LC_hd_global_2012`` layer as the :guilabel:`Input` and click
    :guilabel:`Run`.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/25.png
   :align: center

26. Once the new output is loaded, you can compare the changes in the Croplands
    from 2001 to 2012.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/26.png
   :align: center

27. It is always a good idea to add documentation to your model. The modeler
    has a built-in :guilabel:`Help editor` that allows you to embed help
    directly in the model. Right-click the ``vectorize`` model and select
    :guilabel:`Edit model`.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/27.png
   :align: center

28. Click the :guilabel:`Edit model help` button from the toolbar.

.. image:: /static/processing_graphical_modeler/images/28.png
   :align: center

29. In the :guilabel:`Help editor` dialog, select any item from the
    :guilabel:`Select element to edit` panel and enter the help text in
    :guilabel:`Element description`. Click :guilabel:`OK`. This help will be
    available in the :guilabel:`Help` tab when you launch the model to run.

Models can be a great timesaver and allow you to write your workflow once and
run it multiple times. You can even share your model with other users. The
model files are saved in the ``.qgis2`` directory. You can send the ``.model``
file to another user who can copy it to the appropriate directory on their
computer and it will appear in the :guilabel:`Processing toolbox`. The models
directory location will depend on the platform as follows: (Replace
``username`` with your login name)

**Windows**

.. code-block:: none

   c:\Users\username\.qgis2\processing\models\

**Mac**

.. code-block:: none

   /Users/username/.qgis2/processing/models/

**Linux**

.. code-block:: none

   /home/username/.qgis2/processing/models/
