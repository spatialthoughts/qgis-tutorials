msgid ""
"Calculation of water balance, flood modeling, runoff forecasting, climate "
"studies etc. often need the average depth of rainfall in a hydrological "
"basin as an input. This estimation is called Areal Precipitation or Areal "
"Mean Rainfall (AMR)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/3/areal_mean_rainfall.rst:6
msgid ""
"AMR calculation can be done using rain gauge data. By using the rain gauge "
"location and observed precipitation, one can estimate the average "
"precipitation at a given location by using any of the following techniques:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/3/areal_mean_rainfall.rst:8
msgid ""
"**Arithmetic Average**: One can simply take an average of all the observed "
"values. This method assumes that the rainfall field is homogeneous and that "
"the rain gauge observations are independent and give equal weight to all "
"rain gauges."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/3/areal_mean_rainfall.rst:10
msgid ""
"**Thiessen Polygon**: This method divides the area using Thiessen polygons "
"with the assumption that rainfall is homogeneous within the coverage area of"
" each station. This method is also called an area-weighted average. These "
"assumptions are fine for low-lying or flat terrain, but not suitable for "
"mountainous terrain."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/3/areal_mean_rainfall.rst:12
msgid ""
"**Iso-hyetal Method**: This interpolation technique calculates Isohyets - "
"lines joining equal precipitation. It assumes that rainfall between 2 "
"isohyets is homogeneous. This method is suitable when the rain-gauge network"
" is dense."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/3/areal_mean_rainfall.rst:14
msgid ""
"**Distance Weighting/Gridded** - This is an interpolation technique where a "
"raster grid is created and a value for each pixel is estimated based on the "
"distance to stations. Once the grid points have all been estimated they are "
"summed and the sum is divided by the number of grid cells to obtain the "
"areal mean precipitation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/3/areal_mean_rainfall.rst:16
msgid ""
"**Geostatistical Methods**: Rainfall is strongly influenced by local factors"
" - such as elevation. Using multivariate regression or Kriging techniques, "
"one can account for spatial autocorrelation and can achieve better accuracy."
" These methods are suited when the distribution of the rain gauge station is"
" uniform and dense."
