"You can automate a lot of tasks in QGIS using Python scripting (PyQGIS) and "
"the Processing Framework. Most of the time, you would run these scripts "
"manually while QGIS is open. While that is helpful, many times you need a "
"way to run this jobs via the command-line and without needing to open QGIS. "
"Fortunately, you can write standalone python scripts that use QGIS libraries"
" and can be run via the command-line. In this tutorial, we will learn how to"
" write and schedule a job that uses the QGIS Processing framework."

"Let's say we are working on some analysis using shapefiles of a region. The "
"shapefiles are updated on a daily basis and we always need the latest file. "
"But before we can use these files, we need to cleanup the data. We can setup"
" a QGIS job that automates this process and runs it daily so you have the "
"latest cleaned up shapefiles for your work. We will write a standalone "
"Python script that downloads a shapefile and run topological cleaning "
"operations on a daily basis."
