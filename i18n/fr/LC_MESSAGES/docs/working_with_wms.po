"Often you need reference data layers for your basemap or to display your "
"results in the context of other datasets. Many organizations publish "
"datasets online that can be readily used in GIS. A popular standard for "
"publishing maps online is called **WMS (Web Map Service)**. This is a better"
" choice for using reference layers as you get access to rich datasets in "
"your GIS without the hassle of downloading or styling the data."

"Name your connection. This is not the name of the layer but the name of "
"service which is offering the WMS layer. A single service usually offers "
"multiple layers that can be added to your project. The URL that you need to "
"access a WMS layer is called *GetCapabilities*. When you access a WMS server"
" with this parameter in the URL, it returns a list of layers available along"
" with various metadata. In this case, name the connection as ``MRDATA USGS``"

"``http://mrdata.usgs.gov/services/ca?request=getcapabilities&service=WMS&version=1.1.1&``."

"Quality: PNG is a lossless compressed image format. JPEG is lossy compressed"

"You will see the layer loaded in the QGIS canvas. You can zoom/pan around "
"just like any other layer. The way WMS service works is that every time you "
"zoom/pan, it sends your viewport coordinates to the server and the server "
"creates an image for that viewport and return it to the client. So there "
"will be some delay before you see the image for the area after you have "
"zoomed in. Also, since the data you see is an image, there is no way to "
"query for attributes like in a regular vector/imagery layer."
