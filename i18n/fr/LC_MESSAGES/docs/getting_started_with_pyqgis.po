"QGIS has a powerful programming interface that allows you to extend the core"
" functionality of the software as well as write scripts to automate your "
"tasks. QGIS supports the popular Python scripting language. Even if you are "
"a beginner, learning a little bit of Python and QGIS programming interface "
"will allow you to be much more productive in your work. This tutorial "
"assumes no prior programming knowledge and is intended to give an "
"introduction to python scripting in QGIS (PyQGIS)."

"You will see a new panel open at the bottom of QGIS canvas. You will see a "

"interacting with the QGIS environment, we must use the ``iface`` variable. "
"To access the currently active layer in QGIS, you can type the following and"

"There is a handy function called ``dir()`` in python that shows you all "

"You will see a long list of available functions. For now, we will use a "
"function called ``getFeatures()`` which will gets you the reference to all "
"features of a layer. In our case, each feature will be a point representing "
"an airport. You can type the following command to iterate through each of "
"the features in the current layer. Make sure to add 2 spaces before typing "

"As you will see in the output, each line contains a reference to a feature "

"So now you know how to programatically access the attribute of each feature "
"in a layer. Now, let's see how we can access the coordinates of the feature."
" The coordinates of a vector feature can be accessed by calling the "
"``geometry()`` function. This function returns a geometry object that we can"
" store in the variable ``geom``. You can run ``asPoint()`` function on the "
"geometry object to get the x and y coordinates of the point. If your feature"
" is a line or a polygon, you can use ``asPolyline()`` or ``asPolygon()`` "
"functions. Type the following code at the prompt and press :kbd:`Enter` to "
"see the x and y coordinates of each feature."

#: ../../source/docs/getting_started_with_pyqgis.rst:140

"Now we have all the pieces that we can stitch together to generate our "

"You can see the output printed on the console. A more useful way to store "
"the output would be in a file. You can type the following code to create a "
"file and write the output there. Replace the file path with a path on your "
"own system. Note that we add ``\\n`` at the end of our line formatting. This"
" is to add a newline after we add the data for each feature. You should also"
" note the ``unicode_line = line.encode('utf-8')`` line. Since our layer "
"contains some features with unicode characters, we can't simply write it to "
"a text file. We encode the text using the UTF-8 encoding and then write to "
"the text file."
