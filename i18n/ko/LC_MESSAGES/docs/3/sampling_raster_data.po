"Many scientific and environmental datasets come as gridded rasters. "
"Elevation data (DEM) is also distributed as raster files. In these raster "
"files, the parameter that is being represented is encoded as the pixel "
"values of the raster. Often, one needs to extract the pixel values at "
"certain locations or aggregate them over some area. This functionality is "
"available in QGIS via processing algorithms. ``Sample raster values`` for "
"point layers and ``Zonal Statistics`` for polygon layers."
