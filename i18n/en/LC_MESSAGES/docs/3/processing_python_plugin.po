"In the previous tutorial :doc:`building_a_python_plugin`, you learnt how to "
"create a python plugin - including the user interface and custom logic for "
"processing the data. While these type of plugins are useful, it puts the "
"burden of designing the user interface on the plugin author. This results in"
" each plugin having different ways to interact with it - which is confusing "
"to the users. Also, regular plugins do not interact with another parts of "
"QGIS. For example, you cannot use the plugin functionality from another "
"algorithm. If the plugin that you want to write is primarily for analysis, "
"and the user interaction that you want is limited to letting the user pick "
"inputs and outputs, there is a much easier and preferred way to write "
"plugins using the Processing Framework. It removes the need for you to "
"design the user interface - simplifying the process. The built-in processing"
" library creates a standard processing interface depending on your inputs "
"that looks and behaves just like any other processing algorithm in QGIS. It "
"also seamlessly integrates with rest of the Processing framework - so your "
"plugin algorithms can be used in batch processing, graphical modeler, called"
