"Service area analysis is useful in evaluating accessibility of locations. "
"Given locations of fire stations, hospitals, public transit stations etc. "
"you can use such analysis to identify what areas can be served from these "
"locations by either amount of distance traveled or by time taken. Till "
"recently, such analysis was difficult using open-source tools and data. But "
"now we have access to a global street network using OpenStreetMap (OSM) and "
"free web-services such as Openrouteservice (ORS) that can perform complex "
"routing tasks using OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. In this tutorial, we will use "
"the **ORS Tools Plugin** to perform service area analysis in QGIS."
