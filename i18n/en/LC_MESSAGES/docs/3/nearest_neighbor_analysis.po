"GIS is very useful in analyzing spatial relationship between features. "
"One such analysis is finding out which features are closest to a given "
"feature. There are multiple ways to do this analysis in QGIS. In this "
"tutorial,wWe will explore the **Distance to nearest hub** and **Distance "
"matrix** tools to carry out the nearest neighbor analysis."
