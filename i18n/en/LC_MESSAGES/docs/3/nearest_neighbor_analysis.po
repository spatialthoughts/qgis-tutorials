"GIS is very useful in analyzing spatial relationship between features. One "
"such analysis is finding out which features are closest to a given feature. "
"There are multiple ways to do this analysis in QGIS. You can do a spatial "
"join using the **Join Attributes by Nearest** or get the distances to all "
"features from another layer using the **Distance Matrix** tool from the "
"Processing Toolbox.  In this tutorial, we will explore a tool named "
"**Distance to nearest hub** from the Processing Toolbox that can not only "
"find the distance to the closest feature but join it with a line to it for "
"visualizing the results."
