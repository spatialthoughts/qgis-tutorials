"Interpolation is a commonly used GIS technique to create a continuous "

" elevations, soils, temperatures, etc. If we wanted to model these surfaces "
"for analysis, it is impossible to take measurements throughout the surface. "
"Hence, the field measurements are taken at various points along the surface "
"and the intermediate values are inferred by a process called "
"‘interpolation’. In QGIS, interpolation is achieved using the built-in "
"Interpolation tools from the Processing toolbox."
