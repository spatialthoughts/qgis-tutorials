"Interpolation is a commonly used GIS technique to create a continuous "
"surface from discrete points. A lot of real-world phenomena are "
"continuous - elevations, soils, temperatures, etc. If we wanted to model "
"these surfaces for analysis, it is impossible to take measurements "
"throughout the surface. Hence, the field measurements are taken at "
"various points along the surface and the intermediate values are inferred"
" by a process called ‘interpolation’. In QGIS, interpolation is achieved "
"using the built-in Interpolation tools from the Processing toolbox."
