"In the previous tutorial, :doc:`basic_network_analysis`, we learned how to "
"build a network and calculate the shortest path between 2 points. We can "
"apply that technique to many different types of network-based analysis. One "
"such application is to compute **Origin-Destination Matrix** or **OD "
"Matrix**. Given a set of origin points and another set of destination "
"points, we can calculate the shortest path between each origin-destination "
"pairs and find out the travel distance/time between them. Such analysis is "
"useful to locate the closest facility to any given point. For example, a "
"logistics company may use this analysis to find the closest warehouse to "
"their customers to optimize delivery routes. Here we use the Distance Matrix"
" algorithm from **QGIS Network Analysis Toolbox (QNEAT3)** plugin to find "
"the nearest health facility to each address in the city."
