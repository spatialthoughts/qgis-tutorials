"When working with vector data layers, you may encounter geometry errors. "
"These errors often become part of your data after running geoprocessing, "
"digitizing, editing or data conversion. QGIS3 comes with build-in tools "
"and algorithms to detect and fix invalid geometries. This tutorial will "
"show you a typical workflow for handling invalid geometries in your data."

"Different software systems implement different notions of geometry "
"validity. But the leading standard for the geometry model for use in a "
"GIS is the OGC `Simple Features Specifications (SFS) "
"<https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfs>`_. In this tutorial, we "
"will use GEOS library to check for geometry validity which uses this "
"standard. `This post <https://knowledge.safe.com/articles/21674/invalid-"
"ogc-geometry-examples.html>`_ gives a good overview of common geometry "
"errors as defined by the OGC standard."

":menuselection:`Settings --> Options --> Processing --> General --> "
"Invalid features filtering` and is set to ``Skip (ignore) features with "
