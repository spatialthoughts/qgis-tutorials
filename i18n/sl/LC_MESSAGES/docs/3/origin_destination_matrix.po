"In the previous tutorial, :doc:`basic_network_analysis`, we learnt how to "
"build a network and calculate the shortest path between 2 points. We can "
"apply that technique for many different types of network-based analysis. One"
" such application is to compute **Origin-Destination Matrix** or **OD "
"Matrix**. Given a set of origin points and another set of destination "
"points, we can calculate shortest path between each origin-destination pairs"
" and find out the travel distance/time between them. Such analysis is useful"
" to locate the closest facility to any given point. For example, a logistics"
" company may use this analysis to find the closest warehouse to their "
"customers to optimize delivery routes. Here we use Distance Matrix algorithm"
" from **QGIS Network Analysis Toolbox (QNEAT3)** plugin to find the nearest "
"health facility to each address in the city."
