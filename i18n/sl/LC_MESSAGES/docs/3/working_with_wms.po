"Often you need reference data layers for your basemap or to display your "
"results in the context of other datasets. Many organizations publish "
"datasets online that can be readily used in GIS. A popular standard for "
"publishing maps online is called **WMS (Web Map Service)**. This is a better"
" choice for using reference layers as you get access to rich datasets in "
"your GIS without the hassle of downloading or styling the data."

"**Quality**: File compression for a PNG is lossless, for JPEG it is a lossy "

"Now a :guilabel:`Probabilities of Urban Expansion to 2030` layer will be "

"the WMS service works is that every time you zoom/pan, it sends your "
"viewport coordinates to the server and the server creates an image for that "
"viewport and returns it to the client. So, there will be some delay before "
"you see the image for the area after you have zoomed in. Hence, an internet "
