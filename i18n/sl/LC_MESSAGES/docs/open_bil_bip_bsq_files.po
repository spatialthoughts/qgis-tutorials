"When dealing with remote sensing and scientific datasets, one often comes "
"across data in formats like **BIL**, **BIP** or **BSQ**. `The GDAL library "
"<http://www.gdal.org>`_ - which is used by QGIS to read raster files - has "
"support for these formats, but it cannot open these files by itself. We will"
" go through the process of creating support files so these formats can be "
"read by QGIS."

"Typically, these files are accompanies by a ``.hdr`` file. If your dataset "
"came with a ``.hdr`` file, make sure the root name of the .bil, .bsq or .bip"
" file and the .hdf files match and they are in the same directory. For "
"example, if the file is called ``image.bil`` , the associated file should be"
" named ``image.hdr`` and present in the same directory as the ``image.bil`` "
"file. Then when you go to :menuselection:`Layer --> Add Raster Layer`, "

"To overcome this error, we will create a header file with ``.hdr`` "

"Open a text editor and create a file in the format specified in the previous"

"are easy to understand. The **ncols** and **nrows** come from the metadata "
"as the Number of Lines and Number of Pixels per Line. The **cellsize** is 1 "
"as the Pixel resolution from the metadata. The X,Y coordinate of lower-left "
"corner needs to be worked out by us. Since the file covers the entire world "
"and units are lat/long, **xllcorner** and **yllcorner** are -180 and -90 "
"respectively. We do not have any information about the nodata_value, so "
"-9999 is a safe bet. From metadata again, Pixel Format is Byte, so **nbits**"
" will equal to 8 and pixeltype will be **byte_unsigned**. We do not have "
