"In the tutorial :doc:`georeferencing_basics` we covered the basic process of"
" georeferencing in QGIS. That method involved reading the coordinates from "
"your scanned map and inputting it manually. Many times though you may not "
"have the coordinates printed on your map, or you are trying to georeference "
"an image. In that case, you can use another georeferenced data source as "
"your input. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use existing open data "
"sources in your georeferencing process."

"Now you have the OpenStreetMap layer loaded in QGIS. Note the Coordinate "

"this layer will be in this CRS."

"Now the task is to locate the general vicinity of the area that we are "
"trying to georeference. You can just use Pan and Zoom tools to locate that "
"area on the OpenStreetMap layer. But we can take this opportunity to "
"demonstrate another tool that may help you in future. We know that the image"
" we downloaded is for Washington Square Park in New York. If you search for "
"that place, you will be able to locate the wikipedia page for it. The "
"coordinates for the park are listed there."

"You will notice that the coordinates are in Degrees/Minute/Seconds and are "
"Latitude and Longitude. But since our layer is in Mercator projection, we "
"will need Mercator coordinates to locate the park. Here’s where a command-"
"line tool called **cs2cs** comes handy. If you have installed QGIS from "
"OSGeo4W installer, you will already have it installed on your system. On "
"Linux and Mac too, it comes pre-installed with QGIS. Launch a terminal "
"window and type ``cs2cs`` to check if it is available. Windows users can "

msgid ""
"Once you have verified that the cs2cs tool exists on your system, it is time"
" to convert out Latitude and Longitude to Mercator coordinates. The way this"
" tool works is that you need to specify a :guilabel:`source` and "
":guilabel:`destination` CRS. The CRS definition could be a `PROJ4 string "
"<http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/wiki/GenParms>`_ or an `EPSG code "
"<http://www.epsg-registry.org/>`_. Since we already know the EPSG code for "
"out input and output CRS, we will use this. The simplest way to use the tool"
" is to supply the input coordinates on the command line itself. Note that "
"the tool accepts coordinates in the order `X Y`, so we need to enter "
"`Longitude Latitude`. Enter the following command in the terminal and press "
"Enter. Note that we need to escape the quotes (\") with a backslash (\\\\). "
"Once you press enter, you will see the tool process the coordinates and "
"print out output X Y coordinates in EPSG 3857 CRS."
