"In the tutorial :doc:`georeferencing_basics` we covered the basic process of"
" georeferencing in QGIS. That method involved reading the coordinates from "
"your scanned map and inputting it manually. Many times though you may not "
"have the coordinates printed on your map, or you are trying to georeference "
"an image. In that case, you can use another georeferenced data source as "
"your input. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use existing open data "
"sources in your georeferencing process."

"You will notice that the coordinates are in Degrees/Minute/Seconds and are "

"OSGeo4W installer, you will already have it installed on your system. On "
"Linux and Mac too, it comes pre-installed with QGIS. Launch a terminal "

"Once you have verified that the cs2cs tool exists on your system, it is time"
" to convert out Latitude and Longitude to Mercator coordinates. The way this"
" tool works is that you need to specify a :guilabel:`source` and "
":guilabel:`destination` CRS. The CRS definition could be a `PROJ4 string "
"<http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/wiki/GenParms>`_ or an `EPSG code <http://www"
".epsg-registry.org/>`_. Since we already know the EPSG code for out input "
"and output CRS, we will use this. The simplest way to use the tool is to "
"supply the input coordinates on the command line itself. Note that the tool "
"accepts coordinates in the order `X Y`, so we need to enter `Longitude "
"Latitude`. Enter the following command in the terminal and press Enter. Note"
" that we need to escape the quotes (\") with a backslash (\\\\). Once you "
"press enter, you will see the tool process the coordinates and print out "
"output X Y coordinates in EPSG 3857 CRS."
