"Cartogram is a type of map visualization where the shape of each feature is "
"distorted in proportion to a variable. Cartograms make it easy to see large "
"variations in the data. The simplest method to create a cartogram is by "
"scaling the size of each region according to a variable. This method retains"
" the original shape of the polygon and only changes the size. These are "
"known as `Non-contiguous isomorphic cartograms "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartogram#Non-"
"contiguous_isomorphic_cartograms>`_. In this tutorial, we will learn how to "
"use QGIS expressions to create a cartogram and use the Temporal Controller "
"to create an animation that gradually transforms the features to the target "
"size."

"more than one part. Such features have 2 or more polygons that are part of "
"the same geometry. With our current expression, both are scaled with the "
"same anchor point computed from the combined geometry. This is not ideal. "
"For example, a large feature with multiple islands should be scaled such "
