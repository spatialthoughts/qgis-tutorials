"Street intersection density is a useful measure of network connectivity. One"
" can extract and aggregate street intersections over a regular grid to "
"calculate the density. This analysis is commonly used in transportation "
"design as well as urban planning to determine walkability of neighborhoods. "
"With the availability of global street network dataset from OpenStreetMap "
"and QGIS, we can easily calculate and visualize intersection density for any"
" region of the world."
