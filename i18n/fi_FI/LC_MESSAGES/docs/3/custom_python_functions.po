"Expressions in QGIS have a lot of power and are used in many core features: "
"selection, calculating field values, styling, labelling etc. QGIS also has "
"support for user-defined expressions. With a little bit of python "
"programming, you can define your own functions that can be used within the "
"expression engine."

"We will define a custom function named ``GetUtmZone`` that will calculate "

"geometry. We will also add a 'N' or 'S' designation to the zone to indicate "
"whether the zone is in the northern or southern hemisphere. Press the "
":guilabel:`+` button in the lower left of the screen and type "
