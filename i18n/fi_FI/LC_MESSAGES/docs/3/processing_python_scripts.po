"One can write standalone pyqgis scripts that can be run via the Python "
"Console in QGIS. With a few tweaks, you can make your standalone scripts run"
" via the Processing Framework. This has several advantages. First, taking "
"user input and writing output files is far easier because Processing "
"Framework offers standardized user interface for these. Second, having your "
"script in the Processing Toolbox also allows it to be part of any Processing"
" Model or be run as a Batch job with multiple inputs. This tutorial will "
"show how to write a custom python script that can be part of the Processing "
"Framework in QGIS."

"The template contains all the boilerplate code that is required for the "

"objects. We first get our inputs using ``parameterAsSource`` and "
"``parameterAsString`` methods. Next we want to create a feature sink where "
"we will write the output. QGIS3 has a new class called ``QgsFeatureSink`` "

"One another advantage of writing processing script is that the methods "
"within the Processing Framework are aware of layer selection and "
"automatically filter your inputs to use only the selected features. This "
"happens because we are defining our input as a "
"``QgsProcessingParameterFeatureSource``. A feature source allows use of ANY "
"object which contains vector features, not just a vector layer, so when "
"there are selected features in your layer and ask Processing to use selected"
" features, the input is passed on to your script as a "
"``QgsProcessingFeatureSource`` object containing selected features and not "
"the full vector layer. Here's a quick demonstration of this functionality. "
