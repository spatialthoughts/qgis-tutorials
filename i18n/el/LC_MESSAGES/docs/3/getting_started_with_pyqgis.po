"QGIS has a powerful programming interface that allows you to extend the core"
" functionality of the software as well as write scripts to automate your "
"tasks. QGIS supports the popular Python scripting language. Even if you are "
"a beginner, learning a little bit of Python and QGIS programming interface "
"will allow you to be much more productive in your work. This tutorial "
"assumes no prior programming knowledge and is intended to give an "
"introduction to python scripting in QGIS (PyQGIS)."

"QGIS provides a built-in console where you can type python commands and get "

"You will see a new panel open at the bottom of QGIS canvas. You will see a "
"prompt like ``>>>`` at the bottom where you can type commands. For "
"interacting with the QGIS environment, we must use the ``iface`` variable. "
"To access the currently active layer in QGIS, you can type the following and"
" press :kbd:`Enter`. This command fetches the reference to the currently "
"loaded layer and stores it in the ``layer`` variable."

"There is a handy function called ``dir()`` in python that shows you all "
"available methods for any object. This is useful when you are not sure what "
"functions are available for the object. Run the following command to see "
"what operations we can do on the ``layer`` variable."

"You will see a long list of available functions. For now, we will use a "
"function called ``getFeatures()`` which will gets you the reference to all "
"features of a layer. In our case, each feature will be a point representing "
"an airport. You can type the following command to iterate through each of "
"the features in the current layer."

"As you will see in the output, each line contains a reference to a feature "
"within the layer. The reference to the feature is stored in the ``f`` "

"feature. Type the following to print the ``name`` and ``iata_code`` for each"
" airport feature."

"So now you know how to programatically access the attribute of each feature "
"in a layer. Let's see how we can access the coordinates of the feature. The "
"coordinates of a vector feature can be accessed by calling the "
"``geometry()`` function. This function returns a geometry object that we can"
" store in the variable ``geom``. You can run ``asPoint()`` function on the "
"geometry object to get the x and y coordinates of the point. If your feature"
" is a line or a polygon, you can use ``asPolyline()`` or ``asPolygon()`` "
"functions. Type the following code at the prompt and press :kbd:`Enter` to "
"see the x and y coordinates of each feature."

#: ../../source/docs/3/getting_started_with_pyqgis.rst:97

"What if we wanted to get only the ``x`` cordinate of the feature? You can "

msgid ""
"Now we have all the pieces that we can stitch together to generate our "
"desired output. Type the following code to print the name, iata_code, "
"latitude and longitude of each of the airport features. Here we are using "
"the ``.format()`` method which gives more control on printing multiple "
"variables. The ``.2f`` notation is to limit the coordinates to 2 decimals."

"You can see the output printed on the console. A more useful way to store "
"the output would be in a file. You can type the following code to create a "
"file and write the output there. Replace the file path with a path on your "
"own system. Note that we add ``\\n`` at the end of our line formatting. This"
" is to add a newline after we add the data for each feature."
