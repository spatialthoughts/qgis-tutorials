"Heatmaps are one of the best visualization tools for dense point data. "
"Heatmap is an interpolation technique that useful in determining density of "
"input features. Heatmaps are most commonly used to visualize crime data, "
"traffic incidents, housing density etc. QGIS has a heatmap renderer that can"
" be used to style a point layer and a Processing algorithm **Heatmap (Kernel"
" Density Estimation)** that can be used to create an raster from a point "
"layer."

"Next you need to choose a :guilabel:`Radius`. This parameter determines the "
"circular neighborhood around each point where that point will have an "
"influence. This value will largely depend on the type of your input data. "
"For our data, let's assume a crime incident will have an influence upto 5 "
"Kilometers from the location. Notice that the current project CRS is set to "
"``EPSG: 3857`` in the bottom-right corner. This CRS has a unit of meter, so "
"we should specify ``5000`` meters as the radius. Another parameter that is "
"hidden from this menu is the :guilabel:`Kernel shape`. This is a function "
"that determines how the influence of a point should be spread out over the "
"given radius. The Heatmap renderer uses the ``Quartic`` function for this "
"calculation. There are other types of kernels such as ``Triangular``, "
"``Uniform``, ``Triweight`` and ``Epanechnikov`` that can be specified in "
"when using a different heatmap creation method described later in this "
"tutorial. See `this post <https://www.geodose.com/2017/11/qgis-heatmap-"

"For many types of analysis, just considering density of points is good "
"enough. But sometimes, you may want to give different importance to each "
"point. A more violent crime should have more influence on the output heatmap"
" than a robbery. Similarly, sometimes a point may represent multiple "
"observations at a single location which needs to be accounted for in the "
"analysis. To do this, you are able to supply an optional numeric **weight** "
"field which specifies a value for each point. Let's add a weight field and "
"use it to improve the heatmap. Right-click the ``2019-02-surrey-street`` "
