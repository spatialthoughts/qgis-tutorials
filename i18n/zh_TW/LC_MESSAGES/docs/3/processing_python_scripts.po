"One can write standalone pyqgis scripts that can be run via the Python "
"Console in QGIS. With a few tweaks, you can make your standalone scripts run"
" via the Processing Framework. This has several advantages. First, taking "
"user input and writing output files is far easier because Processing "
"Framework offers standardized user interface for these. Second, having your "
"script in the Processing Toolbox also allows it to be part of any Processing"
" Model or be run as a Batch job with multiple inputs. This tutorial will "
"show how to write a custom python script that can be part of the Processing "
"Framework in QGIS."

"獨立的 Pyqgis 程式碼可以從 QGIS 中的 Python "
"主控台執行，不過只要經過些微調整，它也可以在處理框架中執行。這麼做的好處有兩個，首先因為處理框架提供了標準化的介面，所以指定輸出入檔變容易了；再來就是你可以指定你的腳本成為處理建模中的一部份，這樣一來就可以使用批次執行一次處理許多輸入檔。本教學將示範如何撰寫可以當成"

"One another advantage of writing processing script is that the methods "

"object which contains vector features, not just a vector layer, so when "
"there are selected features in your layer and ask Processing to use selected"
" features, the input is passed on to your script as a "
"``QgsProcessingFeatureSource`` object containing selected features and not "
"the full vector layer. Here's a quick demonstration of this functionality. "
