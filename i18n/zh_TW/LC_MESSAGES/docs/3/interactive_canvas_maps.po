"1. We will start by creating a grid. To make our grid with global extents, "
"we can load the world map on the canvas. You can type ``world`` in the "
"coordinates box at the bottom of the QGIS window and press "
":guilabel:`Enter`. This is one of the several hidden *easter eggs* in QGIS. "
"You can discover other easter eggs on our `YouTube Channel "
