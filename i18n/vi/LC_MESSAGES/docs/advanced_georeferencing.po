"In the tutorial :doc:`georeferencing_basics` we covered the basic process of"
" georeferencing in QGIS. That method involved reading the coordinates from "
"your scanned map and inputting it manually. Many times though you may not "
"have the coordinates printed on your map, or you are trying to georeference "
"an image. In that case, you can use another georeferenced data source as "
"your input. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use existing open data "
"sources in your georeferencing process."
msgstr "Trong tài liệu hướng dẫn :doc:`georeferencing_basics` chúng tôi giới thiệu quá trình nắn chỉnh ảnh cơ bản trong QGIS. Phương pháp này liên quan đến việc đọc tọa độ từ bản đồ được quét và nhập vào bằng tay. Trong nhiều trường hợp không có tọa độ in trên bản đồ, hoặc cần nắn chỉnh ảnh, bạn cần sử dụng thêm đầu vào là dữ liệu đã được nắn chỉnh tọa độ. Trong tài liệu này,  bạn sẽ  học cách sử dụng các nguồn dữ liệu có sẵn trong quá trình nắn chỉnh. "

"Now the task is to locate the general vicinity of the area that we are "

"area on the OpenStreetMap layer. But we can take this opportunity to "
"demonstrate another tool that may help you in future. We know that the image"

"You will notice that the coordinates are in Degrees/Minute/Seconds and are "

"will need Mercator coordinates to locate the park. Here’s where a command-"
"line tool called **cs2cs** comes handy. If you have installed QGIS from "
"OSGeo4W installer, you will already have it installed on your system. On "
"Linux and Mac too, it comes pre-installed with QGIS. Launch a terminal "
"window and type ``cs2cs`` to check if it is available. Windows users can "

"Once you have verified that the cs2cs tool exists on your system, it is time"
" to convert out Latitude and Longitude to Mercator coordinates. The way this"
" tool works is that you need to specify a :guilabel:`source` and "
":guilabel:`destination` CRS. The CRS definition could be a `PROJ4 string "
"<http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/wiki/GenParms>`_ or an `EPSG code <http://www"
".epsg-registry.org/>`_. Since we already know the EPSG code for out input "
"and output CRS, we will use this. The simplest way to use the tool is to "
"supply the input coordinates on the command line itself. Note that the tool "
"accepts coordinates in the order `X Y`, so we need to enter `Longitude "
"Latitude`. Enter the following command in the terminal and press Enter. Note"
" that we need to escape the quotes (\") with a backslash (\\\\). Once you "
"press enter, you will see the tool process the coordinates and print out "
"output X Y coordinates in EPSG 3857 CRS."
