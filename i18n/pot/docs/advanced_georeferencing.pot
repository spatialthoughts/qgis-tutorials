msgid "In the tutorial :doc:`georeferencing_basics` we covered the basic process of georeferencing in QGIS. That method involved reading the coordinates from your scanned map and inputting it manually. Many times though you may not have the coordinates printed on your map, or you are trying to georeference an image. In that case, you can use another georeferenced data source as your input. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use existing open data sources in your georeferencing process."

If you search for that place, you will be able to locate the wikipedia page for it. The coordinates for the park are listed there."

msgid "You will notice that the coordinates are in Degrees/Minute/Seconds and are Latitude and Longitude. But since our layer is in Mercator projection, we will need Mercator coordinates to locate the park. Here’s where a command-line tool called **cs2cs** comes handy. If you have installed QGIS from OSGeo4W installer, you will already have it installed on your system. On Linux and Mac too, it comes pre-installed with QGIS. Launch a terminal window and type `cs2cs` to check if it is available. Windows users can find a terminal at :menuselection:`Start --> OSGeo4W --> MSYS`."

msgid "Once you have verified that the cs2cs tool exists on your system, it is time to convert out Latitude and Longitude to Mercator coordinates. The way this tool works is that you need to specify a :guilabel:`source` and :guilabel:`destination` CRS. The CRS definition could be a `PROJ4 string <http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/wiki/GenParms>`_ or an `EPSG code <http://www.epsg-registry.org/>`_. Since we already know the EPSG code for out input and output CRS, we will use this. The simplest way to use the tool is to supply the input coordinates on the command line itself. Note that the tool accepts coordinates in the order `X Y`, so we need to enter `Longitude Latitude`. Enter the following command in the terminal and press Enter. Note that we need to escape the quotes (\") with a backslash (\\\\). Once you press enter, you will see the tool process the coordinates and print out output X Y coordinates in EPSG 3857 CRS."
