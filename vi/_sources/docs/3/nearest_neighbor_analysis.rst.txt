Nearest Neighbor Analysis (QGIS3)
=================================

GIS is very useful in analyzing spatial relationship between features. One such analysis is finding out which features are closest to a given feature. There are multiple ways to do this analysis in QGIS. You can do a spatial join using the **Join Attributes by Nearest** or get the distances to all features from another layer using the **Distance Matrix** tool from the Processing Toolbox.  In this tutorial, we will explore a tool named **Distance to nearest hub** from the Processing Toolbox that can not only find the distance to the closest feature but join it with a line to it for visualizing the results.

Overview of the task
--------------------

Given the locations of all known earthquakes between years 1900 and 2000, find out the nearest populated place for each location where the earthquake happened.
 

Get the data
------------

1. For this tutorial we will download a dataset of earthquakes between 1900-2000 from NOAAâ€™s National Geophysical Data Center produces a great dataset of all significant earthquakes since 2150 BC. `Visit the NOAA NCEI portal <https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazel/view/hazards/earthquake/search>`_ and enter :guilabel:`Min` as ``1900`` and :guilabel:`Max` as ``2000``.  This will return all earthquake incidents that occurred and were recorded by NOAA between those years. For other specific results, you can filter with different parameters. Click :guilabel:`Search`.

2. As a result, we got *2585* earthquake incidents. Click on the :guilabel:`Download TSV` icon.

Natural Earth has a nice `Populated Places <http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-populated-places/>`_ dataset. Download the `simple (less columns) dataset <http://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/10m/cultural/ne_10m_populated_places_simple.zip>`_

For convenience, you may directly download a copy of both the datasets from the links
below:

`earthquakes_2021_11_25_14_31_59_+0530.tsv <https://www.qgistutorials.com/downloads/earthquakes_2021_11_25_14_31_59_+0530.tsv>`_

Data Sources: [NCEI]_ [NATURALEARTH]_

Procedure
---------

1. Locate the downloaded ``ne_10m_populated_places_simple.zip`` file in the :guilabel:`Browser` panel and expand it. Drag the ``ne_10m_populated_places_simple.shp`` file to the canvas.

  .. image:: /static/3/nearest_neighbor_analysis/images/01.png
     :align: center

2. You will see a new layer ``ne_10m_populated_places_simple`` loaded in the :guilabel:`Layers` panel. This layer contains the points representing populated places. Now we will load the earthquakes layer. This layer comes as a *Tab Serepated Values (TSV)* text file. To load this file, click the :guilabel:`Open Data Source Manager` button on the :guilabel:`Data Source Toolbar`. You can also use :kbd:`Ctrl + L` keyboard shortcut.

3. In the :guilabel:`Data Source Manager` dialog box, select :guilabel:`Delimited Text`.

     :align: center

4. Click the :guilabel:`...` button next to :guilabel:`File name` and browse to the downloaded ``earthquakes-2021-11-25_13-39-30_+0530.tsv`` file. Depending upon the operating system, you may not see the file at the downloaded directory. If that is the case, switch to :guilabel:`All files (*; .)` in the :guilabel:`Choose a Delimited Text File to Open` dialog. Once opened, select  :guilabel:`Custom delimiters` in the :guilabel:`File format` section, and check ``Tab``. In the :guilabel:`Geometry definition` section, choose :guilabel:`Point coordinates`. By default :guilabel:`X field` and :guilabel:`Y field`  values will be auto-populated with the appropriate fields in the input. In our case, they are ``Longitude`` and ``Latitude``. You can leave the :guilabel:`Geometry CRS` to the default ``EPSG:4326 - WGS 84`` CRS. If your file contains coordinates in a different CRS, you could select the appropriate CRS here. Click :guilabel:`Add` followed by :guilabel:`Close`.

5. Zoom around and explore both datasets. Each red point represents the location of an earthquake incidence, and each green point represents the location of a populated place. Our goal is to find out the nearest point from the populated places layer for each of the points in the earthquake layer. Let's inspect the Attribute table of the earthquakes layer. Select the layer and click on :guilabel:`Open Attribute Table` icon in :guilabel:`Toolbar`. 

  .. image:: /static/3/nearest_neighbor_analysis/images/05.png
     :align: center

6.  There are ``2586`` features, but the data contains few entries with no latitude or longitude infomation. We have to remove that before proceeding further. Close the Attribute Table.

     :align: center

7.  Go to :menuselection:`Processing --> Toolbox --> Vector geometry --> Remove null geometries` tool. Double-click to open it. 

  .. image:: /static/3/nearest_neighbor_analysis/images/07.png
     :align: center

8. In the :guilabel:`Remove Null Geometries` dialog box, select ``earthquakes-2021-11-25_13-39-30_+0530`` as the :guilabel:`Input layer` and check the box :guilabel:`Also remove empty geometries`. Click :guilabel:`Run`. Once the processing finishes, click :guilabel:`Close`.

  .. image:: /static/3/nearest_neighbor_analysis/images/08.png
     :align: center

9. A new layer ``Non null geometries`` will be added to the :guilabel:`Layers` panel. For analysis we will use this layer instead of the original layer. Un-check the ``earthquakes-2021-11-25_13-39-30_+0530`` layer in the :guilabel:`Layers` panel to hide it. Select the ``Non null geometries`` layer and click the :guilabel:`Open Attribute Table` button from the :guilabel:`Attributes Toolbar`.

  .. image:: /static/3/nearest_neighbor_analysis/images/09.png
     :align: center

10. You will see a lower count for total features as all rows with empty latitude and longitude values were removed. Close the attribute table.

     :align: center

11. Now it is time to perform the nearest neighbor analysis. Search and locate the :menuselection:`Processing --> Toolbox --> Vector analysis --> Distance to nearest hub (line to hub)` tool. Double-click to launch it.

     :align: center

.. note::

  We can also add a point layer as output, use the *Distance to nearest hub (points)* tool for that.
  
12. In the :guilabel:`Distance to Nearest Hub (Line to Hub)` dialog box, select ``Non null geometries``  as the :guilabel:`Source points layer`. Select ``ne_10m_populated_places_simple`` as the :guilabel:`Destination hubs layer`. Select ``name`` as the :guilabel:`Hub layer name attribute`. The tool will also compute the straight-line distance between the populated place and the nearest earthquake. Set ``Kilometers`` as the :guilabel:`Measurement unit`. Click on ``...``  in :guilabel:`Hub Distance` and click :guilabel:`Save to File...` to save the file as ``earthquakes_with_nearest_city.gpkg`` . Click :guilabel:`Run`.  Once the processing finishes, click :guilabel:`Close`.

     :align: center

13. Back in the main QGIS window, you will see a new line layer called ``earthquakes_with_nearest_city`` loaded in the :guilabel:`Layers` panel. This layer has line features connecting each earthquake point to the nearest populated place. Select the ``earthquakes_with_nearest_city`` layer and click :guilabel:`Open Attribute Tabel` icon in :guilabel:`Toolbar`. 

  .. image:: /static/3/nearest_neighbor_analysis/images/13.png
     :align: center

14. Scroll right to the last columns, and you will see 2 new attributes called **HubName** and **HubDist** added to the original earthquake features. This is the name of the distance to the nearest neighbor from the populated places layer.
