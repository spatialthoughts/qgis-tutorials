Calculating Raster Area (QGIS3)
===============================

Many applications require quantifying the landuse patterns in a region. Land Use Land Cover (LULC) datasets come as raster files where each pixel is assigned a class value. GIS analysts often needs to generate reports based on this data by computing the area per class in a given region. QGIS comes with many built-in tools to calculate and summarize raster area.

.. note::

	Historically the suggested approach for calculating areas for rasters was to convert the raster to a vector layer and use vector area calculation techniques. This approach is quite computationally intensive and error-prone. The recommended approach is to use the processing tool **Raster layer unique values report** which can directly compute the pixel areas. If you have a layer with many polygons and need areas for each of them, you can use the **Zonal histogram** tool to get pixel counts for each class and then multiply it with the area of each pixel.

Overview of the task
--------------------

We will be using a raster layer with 11 land cover classes and calculate the area of each class within a national park. We will also post-process the results to create a spreadsheet with class names and areas.
