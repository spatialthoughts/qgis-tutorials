Building a Python Plugin (QGIS3)
================================

Plugins are a great way to extend the functionality of QGIS. You can write plugins using Python that can range from adding a simple button to sohpisticated toolkits. This tutorial will outline the process involved in setting up your development environment, designing the user interface for a plugin and writing code to interact with QGIS. Please review the :doc:`getting_started_with_pyqgis` tutorial to get familiar with the basics. 

.. note::

  If you are building a new plugin, I strongly recommend building a Processing Plugin instead of the GUI plugin described in this tutorial. See  :doc:`processing_python_plugin` for details.
  
Overview of the Task
--------------------

We will develop a simple plugin called ``Save Attributes`` that will allow users to pick a vector layer and write its attributes to a CSV file. 

Get the Tools
-------------

Qt Creator
^^^^^^^^^^
`Qt <http://www.qt.io/>`_ is a software development framework that is used to develop applications that run on Windows, Mac, Linux as well as various mobile operating systems. QGIS itself is written using the Qt framework. For plugin development, we will use an application called `Qt Creator <https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtdesigner-manual.html>`_ to design the interface for our plugin. 

Download and install the Qt Creator installer from `Qt Offline Installers <https://www.qt.io/offline-installers>`_. Make sure you select **Qt Creator** on the download page. Note that you will have to create a free Qt account to install the package.

.. note:: 

  OSGeo4w installer for QGIS on Windows include a copy of **Qt Designer** program which is a lightweight version of **Qt Creator** and perfectly suitable for building plugins. You may skip downloading Qt Creator and use it instead from :menuselection:`C:\\OSGeo4W64\\bin\\qgis-designer`.

Python Bindings for Qt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since we are developing the plugin in Python, we need to install the python
bindings for Qt. The method for installing these will depend on the platform
you are using. For building plugins we need the ``pyrcc5`` command-line tool.

**Windows**

Relevant python bindings are included in the QGIS install on Windows. But to use them from the plugin folder, we need to indicate the path to the QGIS install. 

Create a Windows Batch file (.bat extension) with the following content and save it on your computer as ``compile.bat``. We will later copy this file to the plugin folder. If you installed QGIS at a different path, replace the ``C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\`` with your path.

.. code-block:: none

  @echo off
  call "C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\o4w_env.bat"
  call "C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\qt5_env.bat"
  call "C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\py3_env.bat"

  @echo on
  pyrcc5 -o resources.py resources.qrc
  

.. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/setup2.png
  :align: center

**Mac**

Install the `Homebrew <http://brew.sh>`_ package manager. Install ``PyQt`` package by running the following command:

.. code-block:: none

   brew install pyqt

**Linux**
 Depending on your distribution, find and install the ``python-qt5`` package. On Ubuntu and Debian-based distributions, you can run the following command: 
 
.. code-block:: none

   sudo apt-get install python-qt5

.. note::
   You may find that QGIS has already installed this package.

A Text Editor or a Python IDE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any kind of software development requires a good text editor. If you already have a favorite text editor or an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), you may use it for this tutorial. Otherwise, each platform offers a wide variety of free or paid options for text editors. Choose the one that fits your needs.

This tutorial uses Notepad++ editor on Windows.

**Windows**

`Notepad++ <http://notepad-plus-plus.org/>`_ is a good free editor for windows.
Download and install the `Notepad++ editor
<https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/>`_.

.. note::

  If you are using Notepad++, makes sure to go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Preferences --> Tab Settings` and enable :guilabel:`Replace by space`. Python is very sensitive about whitespace and this setting will ensure tabs and spaces are treated properly.
  
Plugin Builder plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is a helpful QGIS plugin named ``Plugin Builder`` which creates all the necessary files and the boilerplate code for a plugin. Find and install the ``Plugin Builder`` plugin. See :doc:`../using_plugins` for more details on how to install plugins.

Plugins Reloader plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is another helper plugin which allows iterative development of plugins. Using this plugin, you can change your plugin code and have it reflected in QGIS without having to restart QGIS every time. Find and install the ``Plugin Reloader`` plugin. See :doc:`../using_plugins` for more details on how to install plugins.

.. note::

   Plugin Reloader is an experimental plugin. Make sure you have checked :guilabel:`Show also experimental plugins` in :guilabel:`Plugin Manager` settings if you cannot find it.

Procedure
---------

1. Open QGIS. Go to :menuselection:`Plugins --> Plugin Builder --> Plugin Builder`.

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/1.png
     :align: center

2. You will see the :guilabel:`QGIS Plugin Builder` dialog with a form. You can fill the form with details relating to our plugin. The :guilabel:`Class name` will be the name of the Python Class containing the logic of the plugin. This will also be the name of the folder containing all the plugin files. Enter ``SaveAttributes`` as the class name. The :guilabel:`Plugin name` is the name under which your plugin will appear in the    :guilabel:`Plugin Manager`. Enter the name as ``Save Attributes``. Add a description in the :guilabel:`Description` field. The :guilabel:`Module name` will be the name of the main python file for the plugin. Enter it as ``save_attributes``. Leave the version numbers as they are and enter your name and email address in the appropriate fields. Click :guilabel:`Next`.

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/2.png
     :align: center

3. Enter a brief description of the plugin for the :guilabel:`About` dialog and click :guilabel:`Next`.

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/3.png
     :align: center

4. Select the ``Tool button with dialog`` from the :guilabel:`Template` selector`. The :guilabel:`Text for menu item` value will be how the users will find your plugin in QGIS menu. Enter it as ``Save Attributes as CSV``. The :guilabel:`Menu` field will decide where your plugin item is added in QGIS. Since our plugin is for vector data, select ``Vector``. Click :guilabel:`Next`.

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/4.png
     :align: center

5. Plugin builder will prompt you for the type of files to generate. Keep the default selection and click :guilabel:`Next`.

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/5.png
     :align: center

6. As we do not intend to publish the plugin, you may leave the :guilabel:`Bug tracker`, :guilabel:`Repository` and :guilabel:`Home page` values to default. Check the :guilabel:`Flag the plugin as experimental` box at the bottom and click :guilabel:`Next`.

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/6.png
     :align: center

7. You will be prompted to choose a directory for your plugin. For now, save it to a directory you can locate easily on your computer and click :guilabel:`Generate`.

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/7.png
     :align: center

8. Next, press the :guilabel:`generate` button. You will see a confirmation dialog once your plugin template is created.

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/8.png
     :align: center

.. note::

  You may get a prompt saying that pyrcc5 is not found in the path. You can ignore this message.
  
9. Before we can use the newly created plugin, we need to compile the ``resources.qrc`` file that was created by Plugin Builder. This file is part of the `Qt Resource System <https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/resources.html>`_ which references all binary files used in the plugin. For this plugin, it will only have the plugin icon. Compiling this file generates application code that can be used in the plugin independent which platform the plugin is being run. Follow the platform specific instruction for this step.

**Windows**

You can now copy the ``compile.bat`` file (created during the *Python Bindings for Qt* section at the start) to the plugin folder. Once copied, double-click the file to run it. If the run was successful, you will see a new file called ``resources.py`` in the folder. 

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/9.png
   :align: center

.. note::

  If this step fails, you can launch ``cmd.exe`` and browse to the plugin folder using ``cd`` command. Run the Batch file by running ``compile.bat`` to see the error.
  
**Mac and Linux**

You will need to install ``pb_tool`` first. Open a Terminal and install it via pip.

  .. code-block:: none
  
    sudo pip3 install pb_tool
    
Open a Terminal and go to the plugin directory and type ``pb_tool compile``. This will run the ``pyrcc5`` command that we had installed as part *Python Bindings for Qt* section. 

  .. code-block:: none

    pb_tool compile
  
10. Plugins in QGIS are stored in a special folder. We must copy our plugin directory to that folder before it can be used. In QGIS, locate your current profile folder by going to :menuselection:`Settings --> User Profiles --> Open Active Profile Folder`.

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/10.png
     :align: center

11. In the profile folder, copy the plugin folder to :menuselection:`python --> plugins` subfolder.

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/11.png
     :align: center

12. Now we are ready to have a first look at the brand new plugin we created. Close QGIS and launch it again. Go to :menuselection:`Plugins --> Manage and Install plugins` and enable the ``Save Attributes`` plugin in the    :guilabel:`Installed` tab. 

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/12.png
     :align: center

13. You will notice that there is a new icon in the plugin toolbar and a new menu entry under :menuselection:`Vector --> Save Attributes --> Save Attributes as CSV``. Select it to launch the plugin dialog.

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/13.png
     :align: center
   
14. You will notice a new blank dialog named :guilabel:`Save Attributes`. Close this dialog.

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/14.png
     :align: center
   
15. We will now design our dialog box and add some user interface elements to it. Open the ``Qt Creator`` program and go to :menuselection:`File --> Open File or Project`.

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/15.png
     :align: center

16. Browse to the plugin directory and select the ``save_attributes_dialog_base.ui`` file. Click :guilabel:`Open`.

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/16.gif
     :align: center

.. note::

    Windows hides the ``AppData`` folder so you may not see it in the file selector dialog. You can enter ``AppData`` in the :guilabel:`File name` prompt from its parent directory to open it.
    
17. You will see the blank dialog from the plugin. You can drag-and-drop elements from the left-hand panel on the dialog. We will add a :guilabel:`Combo Box` type of :guilabel:`Input Widgets`. Drag it to the plugin dialog.

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/17.png
     :align: center

18. Resize the combo box and adjust its size. Now drag a :guilabel:`Label` type :guilabel:`Display Widget` on the dialog.
    
  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/18.png
     :align: center

19. Click on the label text and enter ``Select a layer``.

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/19.png
     :align: center

20. Save this file by going to :menuselection:`File --> Save save_attributes_dialog_base.ui`. Note the name of the combo box object is ``comboBox``. To interact with this object using python code, we will have to refer to it by this name.

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/20.png
     :align: center
   
21. Let's reload our plugin so we can see the changes in the dialog window. Go to :menuselection:`Plugin --> Plugin Reloader --> Choose a plugin to be reloaded`. Select ``SaveAttributes`` in the :guilabel:`Configure Plugin reloader` dialog.

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/21.png
     :align: center
   
22. Click the :guilabel:`Reload plugin` button to load the latest version of the plugin. Click the :guilabel:`Save Attributes as CSV` button to open the newly designed dialog box.

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/22.png
     :align: center
   
23. Let's add some logic to the plugin that will populate the combo box with the layers loaded in QGIS. Go to the plugin directory and load the file ``save_attributes.py`` in a text editor.  First, insert at the top of the file with the other imports:

    .. code-block:: python

      from qgis.core import QgsProject


    Then scroll down to the end and find the ``run(self)`` method. This method will be called when you click the toolbar button or select the plugin menu item. Add the following code at the beginning of the method. This code gets the layers loaded in QGIS and adds it to the ``comboBox`` object from the plugin dialog.
    
    .. code-block:: python

      # Fetch the currently loaded layers
      layers = QgsProject.instance().layerTreeRoot().children()
      # Clear the contents of the comboBox from previous runs
      self.dlg.comboBox.clear()
      # Populate the comboBox with names of all the loaded layers
      self.dlg.comboBox.addItems([layer.name() for layer in layers])

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/23a.png
     :align: center

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/23b.png
     :align: center
   
24. Back in the main QGIS window, reload the plugin by clicking on the :guilabel:`Reload plugin` button. To test this new functionality, we must load some layers in QGIS. After you have loaded some layers, launch the plugin by going to :menuselection:`Vector --> Save Attributes --> Save Attributes as CSV`. You will see that our combo box is now populated with the layer names that are loaded in QGIS.

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/24.png
     :align: center
   
25. Let's add the remaining user interface elements. Switch back to Qt Creator and load the ``save_attributes_dialog_base.ui`` file. Add a ``Label``     :guilabel:`Display Widget` and change the text to ``Select output file``.     Add a ``LineEdit`` type :guilabel:`Input Widget` that will show the output     file path that the user has chosen. Next, add a ``Push Button`` type     :guilabel:`Button` and change the button label to ``...``. Note the object     names of the widgets that we will have to use to interact with them. Save     the file.

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/25.png
     :align: center
     
26. We will now add python code to open a file browser when the user clicks the ``...`` push button and show the select path in the line edit widget. Open     the ``save_attributes.py`` file in a text editor. Add ``QFileDialog`` to     ``QtWidgets`` list of imports at the top of the file.

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/26.png
     :align: center
     
27. Add a new method called ``select_output_file`` with the following code.     This code will open a file browser and populate the line edit widget with     the path of the file that the user chose. Note, how ``getSaveFileName``     returns a tuple with the filename and the filter used.

  .. code-block:: python
  
    def select_output_file(self):
      filename, _filter = QFileDialog.getSaveFileName(
        self.dlg, "Select   output file ","", '*.csv')
      self.dlg.lineEdit.setText(filename)

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/27.png
     :align: center

28. Now we need to add code so that when the `...` button is clicked,     ``select_output_file`` method is called. Scroll down to the ``run`` method and add the following line in the block where the dialog is initialized. This code will connect the ``select_output_file`` method to the ``clicked`` signal of the push button widget. 

  .. code-block:: python

    self.dlg.pushButton.clicked.connect(self.select_output_file)

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/28.png
     :align: center

29. Back in QGIS, reload the plugin and run it. If all went fine, you will be able to click the ``...`` button and select an output text file from your disk.

  .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/29.png
       :align: center

30. When you click :guilabel:`OK` on the plugin dialog, nothing happens. That  is because we have not added the logic to pull attribute information from the layer and write it to the text file. We now have all the pieces in place to do just that. Find the place in the ``run`` method where it says ``pass``. Replace it with the code below. The explanation for this code can be found in :doc:`getting_started_with_pyqgis`.

    .. code-block:: python

      filename = self.dlg.lineEdit.text()
      with open(filename, 'w') as output_file:
        selectedLayerIndex = self.dlg.comboBox.currentIndex()
        selectedLayer = layers[selectedLayerIndex].layer()
        fieldnames = [field.name() for field in selectedLayer.fields()]
        # write header
        line = ','.join(name for name in fieldnames) + '\n'
        output_file.write(line)
        # write feature attributes
        for f in selectedLayer.getFeatures():
          line = ','.join(str(f[name]) for name in fieldnames) + '\n'
          output_file.write(line)

    .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/30.png
       :align: center

31. We have one last thing to add. When the operation finishes successfully, we should indicate the same to the user. The preferred way to give notifications to the user in QGIS is via the ``self.iface.messageBar().pushMessage()`` method. Add ``Qgis`` to ``qgis.core`` list of imports at the top of the file and add the code below at the end of the ``run`` method.

 .. code-block:: python

  self.iface.messageBar().pushMessage(
    "Success", "Output file written at " + filename,
    level=Qgis.Success, duration=3)

 .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/31a.png
       :align: center

 .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/31b.png
       :align: center

32. Now our plugin is ready. Reload the plugin and try it out. You will find that the output text file you chose will have the attributes from the vector layer. 

 .. image:: /static/3/building_a_python_plugin/images/32.png
       :align: center

33. You can zip the plugin directory and share it with your users. They can unzip the contents to their plugin directory and try out your plugin. If this was a real plugin, you would upload it to the `QGIS Plugin Repository <https://plugins.qgis.org/>`_ so that all QGIS users will be able to find and download your plugin.

.. note::

   This plugin is for demonstration purpose only. Do not publish this plugin or
   upload it to the QGIS plugin repository.

Below is the full ``save_attributes.py`` file as a reference.
